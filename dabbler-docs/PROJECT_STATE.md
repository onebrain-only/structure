# Dabbler — Project State

**Audit run:** 2026-09-01 (run 4, launch-readiness refresh — see **§22**) · **Branch:** `Canary` · **HEAD:** `fd4df5a`
**Prior runs:** 2026-08-26 (baseline) · 2026-08-27 (inventory) · 2026-08-28 (hygiene)
**Owner:** `master-analyst` · **Scope:** whole repo + Supabase project `wtncuzcskpigqpmnxwws`
**Verification (2026-09-01):** `flutter analyze --no-pub` → **0 errors**, 37 warnings, 93 issues total.
`flutter test` → **103 tests, all pass.** (Run 1 read 55 warnings / 157 total / 66 tests.)

> **Read §22 first.** As of 2026-09-01 the working tree carries **109 uncommitted files in
> `lib/`** (594 insertions, 30,762 deletions). Measurements taken from the tree describe a
> build that is **not committed, not on `Canary`, and not deployed.** §22a states the gap.

This is a living document. Every concrete claim below carries a `file:line` or a number
produced by a scan in this run. Nothing here is estimated.

## 1. Executive summary

Ranked by impact.

1. **Unauthenticated cross-tenant data leak.** `public.v_notifications_feed` and
   `v_notifications_ranked` are `SECURITY DEFINER` views over `notifications` with **no
   `WHERE to_user_id = auth.uid()`**. Queried as the `anon` role — the key that ships inside
   the public web bundle — they return **609 rows across 49 distinct recipients**, exposing
   `to_user_id`, `title`, `body`, `action_route`, `context`. No login required. **CRITICAL.**
2. **The moderation surface is open to `anon` too.** `v_mod_queue_open` returns 9 open
   moderation tickets and `v_safety_overview` returns admin metrics to an unauthenticated
   caller. The app gates the *screens* correctly via `rpc('is_admin')`
   (`lib/features/admin/presentation/screens/moderation_queue_screen.dart:24`) — the
   database does not gate the *data*. **CRITICAL.**
2b. **The definer-view problem is ~2× larger than first reported.** 71 views, **49** `SECURITY DEFINER`, **19** anon-readable with no uid predicate — corrected 2026-08-27 after the original figures took an advisor's finding count for a population count. 5 confirmed leaking, 12 never examined. **CRITICAL.** See `SCHEMA.md` §2 for a per-view position.
3. **The rewards slice is 20,545 LOC of unreachable code.** Its entry point,
   `lib/features/rewards/presentation/providers/rewards_providers.dart`, has **zero
   importers**. Every rewards controller is watched only from inside that same file. The
   only live rewards code is daily check-in (~985 LOC). `FeatureFlags.enableRewards` gates
   a stub.
4. **The `games` clean-architecture stack is dead and would be broken if it weren't.**
   `supabase_games_datasource.dart` issues 20 direct `.from(games)` queries; `public.games`
   has RLS enabled with **zero policies**, so `select count(*) from games` as `authenticated`
   returns **0**. Nothing watches `gamesControllerProvider` outside `games_providers.dart`.
   The live game path uses `v_game_card` + RPCs in
   `lib/features/games/presentation/controllers/game_view_controller.dart:399`.
5. **113 feature flags, 10 of which gate anything.** 98 are read nowhere outside
   `feature_flags.dart`; 5 more exist only to be logged into an analytics snapshot at
   `lib/main.dart:80-92`. `FeatureFlags.squads` is snapshot-only while `lib/features/squads/`
   (136 LOC) has zero importers — the flag promises a feature that does not exist.
6. **Every test covers dead code.** All 5 test files and all 66 passing tests target the
   games clean-arch usecases and `RegisterUseCase` — none of which any screen reaches.
   Zero tests touch the live path: `game_view_controller`, the notification stack,
   `auth_service`, or `profiles_repository_impl`.
7. **`SettingsRepositoryImpl` is 26 methods of `UnimplementedError`**
   (`lib/features/profile/data/repositories/settings_repository_impl.dart:111-237`) and it is
   *wired live* into `privacy_controller.dart:60`. `settings_screen.dart:1194` catches
   `on UnimplementedError` — the author knows and is swallowing it.
8. **6,213 LOC of orphan screens** across 10 files nothing imports, plus a 632-LOC
   `.broken` file still in the tree, plus `_PlaceholderScreen` rendering "Coming Soon" on
   6 registered routes.
9. **Two live bucket-name traps.** `SupabaseConfig.venueImagesBucket = 'venue-images'`
   (`lib/core/config/supabase_config.dart:4`) — no such bucket exists; the real one is
   `venue`, and it has **zero storage policies**, so nothing can be written to it.
   `supabase_profile_datasource.dart:16` hardcodes `'avatars'` — also non-existent.
10. **Documentation is stale but not lying.** `docs/LOCATION.md` and `docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md`
    were last touched 2026-07-12; `lib/features/notifications/` last changed 2026-08-14 and
    was substantially rewritten in between (`c74d6e1`, `3b7fd50`, `09ca8fe`).
    `docs/AGENTS.md` describes a 10-agent roster; 4 agents exist.

## 2. Mental model

Dabbler is a Flutter/Riverpod/GoRouter social-sports app on Supabase, 390 commits over
10 months (2025-10-17 → 2026-08-17), ~226k non-generated Dart LOC across 25 feature slices.
The app has been rebuilt at least twice around the same domain. The **live** architecture is
thin and pragmatic: screens watch Riverpod providers that call `SupabaseConfig`-named tables,
views (`v_game_card`, `v_circle_feed`, `v_squad_card`) and RPCs directly. Layered on top of
that — and largely orphaned from it — sits a **second, textbook clean-architecture stack**
(`domain/repositories` → `data/datasources` → `usecases` → controllers) that was built,
tested, and then routed around. `lib/features/games/`, `lib/features/rewards/`, and
`lib/features/profile/data/` are the three biggest examples. This is the single dominant
structural fact about the repo: roughly a quarter of `lib/` is a parallel implementation that
no route reaches.

Churn over the last 6 months concentrates in `social` (223 file-touches), `data` (206),
`auth_onboarding` (166), `profile` (161) — which is also where the god files and the
`Either`/`Result` split live. The recent commit history (`c74d6e1` through `1b83967`) shows
deliberate cleanup: legacy notification stacks deleted, table names routed through
`SupabaseConfig` (now **0** hardcoded `.from('...')` calls remain), dead UI removed,
`print()` converted to `debugPrint()`. That work is real and it worked — the *notifications*
slice is the healthiest in the repo. The contradiction to flag: `CLAUDE.md` says "No tests
exist yet — start with repository and usecase unit tests." Tests now exist and pass, but
they were written against the abandoned stack, so the claim is stale in a way that
overstates coverage of anything that ships.

## 4. Findings

| ID | Category | File:Line | Sev | Eff | Finding | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-01 | Security | **RESOLVED 2026-08-28** — migration `20260828193807` `kan37_kan38a_definer_view_read_closure`. Verified here as `anon`: `v_notifications_feed` **0 rows**, `v_notifications_ranked` **0 rows** (were 611 across 51 users). Controls in the same transaction returned unchanged — `v_meetup_list` 1, `v_game_card` 216 — so **no cascade and no legitimate read path moved.** Flipped to `security_invoker`; the run-1 CRITICAL is closed. **Both directions on these two views are now shut: write by `20260828160122`, read by this one — neither migration closed the whole job alone.** db: `public.v_notifications_feed` — **KAN-36** | ~~CRITICAL~~ **RESOLVED** | S | `SECURITY DEFINER` view over `notifications` with no `auth.uid()` filter. As `anon`: 609 rows, 49 distinct `to_user_id`. Exposes `title`, `body`, `action_route`, `context` | Add `WHERE to_user_id = auth.uid()` **and** `ALTER VIEW … SET (security_invoker = true)`. Verify with the same `set role anon` probe |
| SEC-02 | Security | db: `public.v_notifications_ranked` — **KAN-37** | CRITICAL | S | Same table, same shape, same 609 rows to `anon` | Same fix as SEC-01 |
| SEC-03 | Security | db: `public.v_mod_queue_open` — **KAN-38/KAN-56** | ~~CRITICAL~~ **RESOLVED 2026-08-29, re-verified 2026-08-30** | S | ~~9 open moderation tickets readable by `anon`~~. Fixed *both* ways: `anon` SELECT revoked, and the view body now carries `AND is_admin(auth.uid())`, so `authenticated` non-admins get 0 rows. See §15b flows 19-21 | Done — no action |
| SEC-04 | Security | db: `public.v_safety_overview` — **KAN-56** | ~~HIGH~~ **RESOLVED 2026-08-29, re-verified 2026-08-30** | S | ~~Admin safety metrics readable by `anon`~~. `anon` SELECT revoked and the view body now carries `WHERE is_admin(auth.uid())`. See §15b flows 19-21 | Done — no action |
| SEC-05 | Security | db: `public.v_circle_feed` | HIGH | S | 6 rows returned to `anon`; circle feeds are scoped content | Add membership predicate; set `security_invoker = true` |
| SEC-06 | Security | db: 49 views, `reloptions IS NULL` | **CRITICAL** | M | **CORRECTED 2026-08-27 — original figures were ~2× understated.** Measured live: **71 views total** (not 49), **49 `SECURITY DEFINER`** (not 25), **19 anon-readable with no `auth.uid()` predicate** (not 8). The original 25 was the Supabase advisor's *finding count* used as a *population count* | Triage all 19 — **2 are PostGIS system views (`geography_columns`, `geometry_columns`) — extension-owned metadata, NOT defects; do not re-flag**, 5 are confirmed leaking, 12 unexamined. Per-view census now in `SCHEMA.md` §2. Default every new view to `security_invoker = true`. KAN-26 |
| SEC-07 | Security | db: `public.games` | HIGH | M | RLS enabled, **zero policies**. `select count(*)` as `authenticated` → 0. All reads flow through definer views instead | Decide explicitly: either write policies on `games`, or delete the direct-table code paths that can never work |

| SEC-09 | Security | Supabase Auth settings | MED | S | Leaked-password protection (HaveIBeenPwned) disabled | Enable in dashboard. Note accounts are passwordless by default (`trg_strip_signup_password`), so blast radius is the optional-password path only |
| SEC-10 | Security | db: `util.schema_tables_columns` | LOW | S | Function has a role-mutable `search_path` | `ALTER FUNCTION … SET search_path = ''` |

On a web build every one is URL-reachable. `socialChat`'s only distinction is that a button pushes it. **Whoever fixes this must know that flipping the flag is not a fix:** setting `messaging = false` does not disable the Message button — the button has no flag on it — it only changes the symptom from "Coming Soon" to a **silent bounce to `/home`** via the redirect at `:1611`. The button is the thing that has to change | **Two separable jobs.** (1) The Message button is the launch-facing half — either hide it until chat exists or build chat; this is the finding `cpo` carries as B4. (2) Delete the six orphan routes and their constants (6 of the 54 unused constants in FLAG-02). Owner: a Flutter agent. Re-check: `grep -rn "socialChat\|socialChatList\|socialMessages\|socialEditPost\|socialAnalytics\|language_selection" lib --include='*.dart' | grep -v route_constants.dart | grep -v app_router.dart` |

It was reported as `/settings/language`. **`/settings/language` is at `:1287` and renders the real 226-line `LanguageSelectionScreen`.** Language switching **works today**: `settings_screen.dart:1064` → `:1072 _showLanguagePicker()` → writes `localeProvider` → `main.dart:254` watches, `:268` passes `locale:` | **Delete the dead route.** Not a launch blocker and it does not touch `/settings/language` |

| SEC-16 | Security | **RESOLVED (PARTIAL) 2026-08-28** — migration `20260828160122` `kan67_revoke_anon_view_write_grants`, applied by `cto`. **Post-state independently verified here, not taken from the report.** `anon`/`authenticated` write on **postgres-owned views: 0** (was 70 granted) · all seven live write paths **false on INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE** · **`anon_readable_views = 48`, unchanged — no read path moved**, which was the risk `SCHEMA.md` §1a warns about · `pg_default_acl` for grantor `postgres` now `anon=rxtm` / `authenticated=rxtm`, so the generative half is closed and new relations no longer inherit write. **Bound — CORRECTED 2026-08-28, and it is stronger than I first recorded it.** I wrote "no insert was attempted, by anyone". That was wrong: **step 5 of the KAN-67 verification block issued a real `INSERT INTO public.v_notifications_feed` with the session role set to `anon`, and the database refused it with `insufficient_privilege`** (KAN-67 comment 10100). **So the deny path on `v_notifications_feed` is observation-verified — a write was issued through the view as the untrusted role and refused — not merely a privilege bit reading false.** **The other six were not exercised, and should not be.** `v_needs_organiser` writes to `auth.users`; the two notification views fire `trg_push_on_notification_insert` over `pg_net`, which no rollback undoes. **The honest bound is: exercised on `v_notifications_feed`, mechanism-verified on the remaining six.** Side-effect check run here independently: `notifications` holds **612 rows**, one added in the last six hours — a genuine `auth.welcome` for a real signup at 10:32 UTC, `kind_key = 'auth.welcome'`, not the probe. **The probe left nothing behind.** **Four things did NOT close and must not be recorded as closed:** (1) **all 184 base tables in `public` still grant `anon` and `authenticated` write** — re-measured today, 184 of 184, unchanged; those are RLS-constrained rather than open, but the narrow re-grant set has to be established before they can be revoked. (2) The **`supabase_admin` default-privilege rule still carries `arwdDxtm`** — `postgres` holds no membership in `supabase_admin`, so it was not executable; deliberate, and it needs a PO decision. (3) **`geography_columns` and `geometry_columns` remain anon-writable** — `supabase_admin`-owned PostGIS, untouched by design per decision 021; verified as the only two views still carrying anon write. (4) **TRIGGER and REFERENCES remain granted** on the seven views — hardening, not a write path. Original finding below, kept for the record | db: **7 app views** → 7 base tables, all `relforcerowsecurity = false`; `v_notifications_feed` + `v_notifications_ranked` → `notifications` → `trg_push_on_notification_insert` | **CRITICAL — highest on the board** | M | **An unauthenticated caller can insert a notification row and have it delivered as a push notification to any user they choose.** Raised by `cto` (`T-017`); every link re-verified here against `wtncuzcskpigqpmnxwws` on 2026-08-28, **catalogue only — the insert was not attempted, by either of us.** **(1) The view is writable by `anon`:** `information_schema.views.is_insertable_into = YES`, `has_table_privilege('anon','public.v_notifications_feed','INSERT') = true`. All three NOT NULL / no-default columns of the base table — `to_user_id`, `kind_key`, `title` — are present in the view, so a row is genuinely constructible. **(2) The block exists and is bypassed — by `rolbypassrls`, not by the owner path.** CORRECTED 2026-08-28. `notifications` has exactly one INSERT policy, `n_block_insert WITH CHECK (false)`, and `relrowsecurity = true`. The `relforcerowsecurity = false` measurement is accurate but **it is not what makes the bypass work**: the view is not `security_invoker` and is owned by **`postgres`, which carries `rolbypassrls = true`**, so RLS is skipped before the owner/FORCE logic is ever reached. **Setting FORCE would not have changed the outcome.** The original entry attributed this to owner-equals-owner; that attribution was wrong. **(3) It reaches the device:** `trg_push_on_notification_insert` is enabled (`tgenabled = 'O'`) and posts `NEW.title` and `NEW.body` **verbatim** to `send-push-notification` with an `x-trigger-secret` header read from the vault — the trusted-server path that skips the JWT and relationship checks. **The attacker chooses `to_user_id` and writes the title and body**, so this is arbitrary push content to a chosen user, delivered on the app's own trusted channel. That is a phishing primitive, not just an integrity bug. **(4) No secret is needed:** `anon` can SELECT `notification_kinds`, and **23 of 29 kinds carry `push` in `default_channels`** (all 29 `is_active`), so the required `kind_key` is public. **One mitigation, and it does not close it:** the trigger honours the *victim's* `notification_settings` — `push_enabled`, `muted_kinds`, quiet hours — so delivery is not guaranteed for every target. It gates reliability, not access. Users with no settings row get no gating at all (`_has_settings` false skips every check). **Note also `has_table_privilege('anon','public.notifications','INSERT') = true`** — a direct grant on the base table. That path *is* blocked, because RLS applies to `anon` there and `n_block_insert` denies it. The grant is still wrong and should go with the rest | **B1a — the highest-value item on the gate. Three parts, and a REVOKE-only migration is not a fix.** (1) `REVOKE` write on all tables/views in `public` from `anon`/`authenticated`, re-granting the narrow set the app actually writes. (2) **`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES … REVOKE` for both grantors** — without this the hole **reopens by itself** on the next migration that creates a view, and a re-run of the verification query would still pass. **(3) is struck — `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` remediates nothing here.** CORRECTED 2026-08-28 (`cto` `T-025`, verified independently). **All seven app views are owned by `postgres`, and `postgres` carries `rolbypassrls = true`.** BYPASSRLS is checked ahead of the owner/FORCE logic, so base-table RLS is skipped for every one of them regardless of FORCE. Demonstrated on a table that already has FORCE set — `public.sport_profiles`, `relforcerowsecurity = true`, owner `postgres`: **138 rows visible, 131 admitted by its policies.** Seven rows no policy admits, with FORCE on. **The fix is two parts, not three.** Severity does not move; the remediation gets smaller. **Not a uid predicate, and not a definer→invoker conversion** — that belongs with the read sweep. **Low blast radius: nothing in the app writes through these views, so revoking write cannot blank a screen** — which is the opposite of how the severity reads, and is the thing to tell the PO when they weigh applying it. Audit every other definer view for a DML grant, not just a SELECT grant. **Owner: blocked — this is notification-domain work and `CONTRACT.md` §3 gives `notifications-specialist` only `supabase/schema/migrations/**` for notification migrations, while `DECISIONS.md` 019 bars every agent from writing production. See `CONTRACT.md` §11; the PO must resolve this before anyone can fix it** **WIDENED 2026-08-28 (`cto` `T-018`, every figure re-measured here).** This is not one view. Of 71 views: **70 grant `anon` INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE · 19 are auto-updatable · all 19 of those carry the write grant · 8 are definer AND auto-updatable AND anon-writable.** The 8: `v_needs_organiser`, `v_my_drafts`, `v_user_reputation`, `geometry_columns`, `v_hidden_list`, `v_posts_time_preview`, `v_notifications_ranked`, `v_notifications_feed`. **`geometry_columns` is the known PostGIS false positive (decision 021) — 7 app views, 1 artefact.** **Every base table they reach has `relforcerowsecurity = false`, so all 7 bypass RLS by the same owner-path mechanism.** Six have exactly one base table, so the write target is unambiguous: `v_notifications_feed` → `notifications`, **`v_notifications_ranked` → `notifications` (a second, previously unrecorded entry to the push trigger)**, `v_posts_time_preview` → `posts`, `v_my_drafts` → `content_drafts`, `v_hidden_list` → `user_hidden_modes`, `v_user_reputation` → `user_reputation_aggregate`. **`v_needs_organiser` — ESTABLISHED 2026-08-28 (`cto` read the `FROM` clause; re-verified here). Its target is `auth.users`, not `profiles`.** `SELECT id AS user_id FROM auth.users u WHERE NOT (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles p WHERE …))` — `profiles` appears **only inside the NOT EXISTS subquery**, which is exactly the pickup my base-table walk could not distinguish. **The bypass here is a different mechanism from the rest of SEC-16 and `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` would not close it.** `auth.users` is owned by `supabase_auth_admin`, **not** by `postgres`, so the owner-equals-owner argument fails — but `postgres` carries **`rolbypassrls = true`** and holds INSERT on `auth.users`, which arrives at the same place by another route. `rolbypassrls` defeats FORCE RLS too. **Only the revoked grant closes this one.** **And the block being bypassed is weaker than elsewhere:** `auth.users` has `relrowsecurity = true` and **zero policies** — a deny-all — which `rolbypassrls` walks straight past. The view projects exactly `id`, and `id` is the **only** NOT NULL / no-default column on `auth.users`. **Two things remain UNESTABLISHED and must stay that way in any writeup:** (a) whether the remaining unique indexes (8) and constraints admit a row carrying only `id`; (b) whether such a row is useful to an attacker. **What is now established against (b): the row would not be inert.** An insert fires two enabled triggers — `trg_create_default_privacy_settings` and `trg_strip_signup_password` — so "harmless orphan" is not the safe default assumption. **This must not be described as account creation or account takeover.** The established claim is exactly: *an unauthenticated write path onto the identity table exists.* **Root cause, and it is generative:** `pg_default_acl` carries `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` in `public` from **both** `postgres` and `supabase_admin` granting `anon` and `authenticated` **`arwdDxtm`** — the full privilege set — on every relation created. Verified; the `storage` schema carries the same. **This is inherited Supabase stock configuration, not something Dabbler authored** — nobody did it wrong, nobody ever turned it off |
| SEC-15 | Security | db: `public.v_game_card`, `public.v_meetup_list` | **MED** | M | **Unauthenticated callers read organiser identity from the public game and meetup listings.** Measured 2026-08-28 as `anon`: `v_game_card` returns **216 rows**, `v_meetup_list` returns **1**; control `select count(*) from public.games` as `anon` returns **0**, so these are definer views reading over a table whose RLS denies `anon` directly. **This is not the §2a leak class and must not be filed with it** — every row returned has `listing_visibility = 'public'`, so the row set is consistent with public game discovery without an account, which is plausibly intended. **NARROWED 2026-08-28 — the `auth.users` UUID half is split out as SEC-17 (HIGH). What remains here is the discovery exposure and it is genuinely MED.** An unauthenticated caller gets, per row: display name, avatar, exact `start_at`, and venue by name. **No coordinates, no address, no phone, no email** — location is venue-and-area names. Every row is `listing_visibility = 'public'`, which is a choice the organiser made about their own game, and **a game-discovery app that cannot show public games to a logged-out browser does not work.** Stated flatly — "named person, at a place, at a time, readable without an account" — it sounds worse than it is; this is the product functioning as designed. the CTO argued it in two independent passes and converged on the same answer | **PO decision, and only a PO decision** — fuzzing venue or gating exact `start_at` behind auth are real product trade-offs against discovery, and no agent should make them. `v_game_card` is the live game path (`game_view_controller.dart:399`) and cannot be revoked. **Holding at MED pending that decision; nothing here blocks the gate** |
| SEC-17 | Security | db: `v_notifications_feed` · `v_notifications_ranked` · `v_game_card` · `v_meetup_list` · `v_circle_feed` | **HIGH** | S | **61 of 240 real `auth.users` UUIDs are readable by an unauthenticated caller — 25% of the user base.** Split out of SEC-15 on the CTO's ruling — reached twice independently, in separate passes — then scoped by me across the whole anon-readable surface rather than the one view they raised. Measured as `anon` 2026-08-28, distinct non-null user ids per view: `v_notifications_feed` and `v_notifications_ranked` **51 uids / 611 rows** · `v_game_card` **25 uids / 216 rows** · `v_circle_feed` **1 uid / 6 rows** · `v_meetup_list` **1 uid / 1 row**. Union of distinct uids: **61**. `cto` confirmed the values are genuine: all 216 `v_game_card` rows have a `creator_user_id` present in `auth.users`. **Why this is HIGH while SEC-15 is MED — nobody decided to publish it.** `listing_visibility` is a product decision an organiser made; the `auth.users` primary key is a column that leaked into a public projection because someone selected too much. `v_game_card` already carries `creator_profile_id` **separately**, so this is the internal identity key sitting *alongside* the public handle, not standing in for it. **Its severity is what it unlocks, not what it reveals.** With 27 anon-granted views in play it is a join key: an auth uid on one public surface makes correlation across the others trivial, which is the *ask what a change multiplies* test applied to a column. `v_game_card` and `v_meetup_list` are the newly found pair (SEC-15); the notification views were already known leaks (SEC-06) — **but the uid column was never counted as a distinct finding, only the rows were** | **Drop the `auth.users` uid from every anon-reachable projection.** Keep `creator_profile_id` / `author_profile_id` and the display fields — the public listings lose nothing. This is **not a PO question**: a public game card has no use for the creator's auth UUID. Then, per `cto`, audit the remaining anon-granted views for the same column, because a copied projection copies the leak — I have done that sweep and the five above are the full set that returns a non-null uid to `anon`; eight more carry such a column but return zero rows and become live the moment their filters change. **DO NOT bundle with B1a — `cto` overruled my recommendation to fold it and the evidence inverts the argument; verified here 2026-08-28.** The two changes have opposite risk profiles. **KAN-67 is `REVOKE` only, privilege-level, and all 8 writable views have _zero_ Dart references** (`v_needs_organiser`, `v_my_drafts`, `v_user_reputation`, `v_hidden_list`, `v_posts_time_preview`, `v_notifications_ranked`, `v_notifications_feed`, `geometry_columns` — 0 each). That makes it the **only production change in the plan that is verifiably risk-free**, which is precisely why it can be reviewed in minutes and shipped first while a destructive hole is open. **Folding a client-affecting change into it destroys that property** — the review that should wave it through would have to reason about Dart call sites instead. **SEC-17 is `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` and touches 3 read sites, not 6 — corrected 2026-08-28 by `cto`, verified here.** `grep -rn 'creator_user_id' lib` returns 6, but a grep count is not a call-site count: two of the six query the **`games` table**, not the view, and are untouched by a view change — `sport_profile_view_provider.dart:264` (`.from(gamesTable)` at `:262`) and `supabase_games_datasource.dart:507` (`.from(gamesTable)` at `:505`). **The 3 that read `v_game_card`:** `game_history_providers.dart:79-80` (`.from(vGameCardTable)` at `:84`), `game_view_controller.dart:212` (`.from(vGameCardTable)` at `:399`), `game_model.dart:81` (the shared parser). **Exactly one of the three is a filter on the view** — `game_history_providers.dart:79-80` builds an `or` filter string on `creator_user_id` and applies it to the view. **That is the dangerous site: dropping the column returns a quietly wrong game history — no error, no log.** The other two are parse sites and would surface as a null. `v_game_card` has 9 references and is registered at `supabase_config.dart:219`. **And it is not a rename — there are four competing identity columns, not two.** Reference counts in `lib/`: **`host_user_id` 23 · `creator_user_id` 6 · `organizer_id` 4 · `creator_profile_id` 1.** The migration target has **one** reference in the entire app, which is the number that sizes this job: it is not a column swap, it is establishing an identity that barely exists yet. `creator_profile_id` is also a *different* identity from the auth `userId` these sites pass down, so each migration is a caller-chain change. And `game_model.dart:81` already reconciles two of them behind an empty-string default — `organizerId: json['creator_user_id'] ?? json['host_user_id'] ?? ''` — which is its own silent-failure vector: a missing identity becomes `''` rather than an error. **And that fallback is dead: `host_user_id` exists on neither `games` nor `v_game_card`** (verified 2026-08-28), so the `?? json['host_user_id']` branch can never fire from either source — it degrades straight to `''`. **`creator_user_id` does exist on the `games` table**, which is why the two `.from(gamesTable)` sites survive a view change untouched. **Add the Dart-side propagation to the migration scope:** `grep -rn 'creatorUserId' lib` returns **6** more occurrences — the typed field at `game_view_controller.dart:130,164`, its assignment at `:212`, and three consumer lines at `game_detail_screen.dart:648-653`, where it is used to route: `context` push to `'${RoutePaths.userProfile}/$creatorUserId'`. **The identity flows into navigation**, so migrating to a profile id changes a route argument, not just a parse. **`cto`'s open question closed 2026-08-28 — no additional in-scope site.** It flagged that `.from(vGameCardTable)` has **8** call sites, not 3, and that the other five were gated behind unexpanded `select(...)` constants it had not checked. Expanded all of them: `_historyColumns` (`game_history_providers.dart:16`), `_cardColumns` (`nearby_games_datasource.dart:65`), and the inline lists at `sports_history_screen.dart:53`, `venues_screen.dart:278` (`venue_id` only) and `active_feed_notifier.dart:303` — **none names `creator_user_id`.** The 3-site scope stands. **But the expansion found something the column lists hide: two sites call bare `.select()` on the view** — `game_composer_screen.dart:213` and `game_view_controller.dart:399` — which returns **every** column, so `creator_user_id` crosses the wire to both even though only `:399` parses it. `game_composer_screen.dart:213` receives the auth UUID and never reads it. **That is exposure surface for SEC-17, not migration scope**: dropping the column from the projection fixes it silently and breaks nothing there. **And it confirms the SEC-15 recommendation:** `active_feed_notifier.dart:303` explicitly selects `creator_display_name` and `creator_avatar_url`, so the display fields are genuinely used and must be kept when the uid goes. **Sequence with the Flutter hire, not with B1a** — migrate the 6 call sites first, then drop the uid from the projection.

History is not missing; reproducibility is. KAN-33 needs rescoping |

## 5. Top 5 priority fixes

**1. Close the notification leak (SEC-01, SEC-02) — hours, not days.**
```sql
create or replace view public.v_notifications_feed as
  select … from notifications where to_user_id = auth.uid() order by created_at desc;
alter view public.v_notifications_feed set (security_invoker = true);
-- repeat for v_notifications_ranked
```
Re-run the probe that found it: `set local role anon; select count(*) from public.v_notifications_feed;`
must return 0. This is user data readable with nothing but the public web bundle's key.

**2. Lock the moderation views (SEC-03, SEC-04). — DONE, KAN-56, verified 2026-08-30.**
`anon` SELECT is revoked on both, and rather than routing through a separate RPC the fix put
the predicate inside the views themselves (`is_admin(auth.uid())` in both bodies). That is a
stronger outcome than this recommendation asked for: `authenticated` may still hold SELECT and
still gets 0 rows. Left here with its outcome so the recommendation and its resolution stay
together. See §15b flows 19-21.

**3. Sweep the remaining definer views (SEC-06) — 19 exposed, not 8.**
The query that produced the list:
```sql
select c.relname, (pg_get_viewdef(c.oid) ilike '%auth.uid()%') as filters_on_uid,
       has_table_privilege('anon', c.oid, 'SELECT')
from pg_class c join pg_namespace n on n.oid=c.relnamespace
where n.nspname='public' and c.relkind='v' and c.reloptions is null;
```
Any row with `filters_on_uid = false` and `anon = true` needs a decision. Make
`security_invoker = true` the default for every view created from here.

**4. Get one PO decision on rewards (DEAD-01), then act on it.**
20,545 LOC hinges on a single question: is the rewards system being built or was it
abandoned? Until that is answered, nobody can safely touch `rewards`, and
`FeatureFlags.enableRewards` keeps advertising a feature that resolves to a stub. If
abandoned: delete everything except `check_in_*`, `early_bird_check_in_modal.dart`,
`check_in_progress_indicator.dart` (~985 LOC survives). That single deletion also removes
65 hardcoded colours, 18 empty catch blocks, and 7 orphan dashboard classes.

**5. Make settings honest (WIRE-01, WIRE-02).**
`SettingsRepositoryImpl` throws on all 26 methods and the settings screen catches the throw.
Minimum viable fix: change every method to return `Err(Failure.unimplemented(...))` per
`CLAUDE.md`'s "never throw across layer boundaries" rule, then delete the
`on UnimplementedError catch` at `settings_screen.dart:1194` so the UI shows a real state.

## 6. Quick wins

Low effort, real payoff.

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| `git rm lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/create_game_screen.dart.broken` | 632 LOC gone, one embarrassing filename gone |
| Delete the 10 orphan screen files (DEAD-05…DEAD-12) | 6,213 LOC gone, 0 behaviour change |
| Delete the 98 never-read feature flags | `feature_flags.dart` drops from 113 flags to 15 |
| Delete the 54 unreferenced route constants | `route_constants.dart` drops from 133 to 79 |
| Remove `dabbler_design_system` + `cupertino_icons` from `pubspec.yaml` | One fewer git clone per clean build |
| Delete `lib/features/{payments,audit_safety,squads,display_names,bench_mode}/` | 958 LOC, 5 slices, 0 importers |
| Fix `print('INSERT PAYLOAD: $data')` at `post_repository_impl.dart` | Stops logging request bodies |
| Fix the 6 empty catches in `profile/services/onboarding_controller.dart` | Live onboarding stops swallowing failures |
| `alter function util.schema_tables_columns set search_path = ''` | Clears the last function advisor |
| Enable leaked-password protection in Supabase Auth | Clears an advisor; low blast radius |

## 7. Agent & skill utilisation

**Agents** — `.claude/agents/`, evidence of runs from `.claude/agent-memory/`.

| Agent | Memory files | Used? | Recommendation |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `notifications-specialist` | 7 | **Yes** — richest memory in the repo (schema, RLS, triggers, edge functions, a 401 delivery post-mortem) | **Keep.** It also owns the fix for SEC-01/02 |
| `app-store-submission-fixer` | 4 | **Yes** — EULA gate, moderation infra, submission 1.7.0 | **Keep** |
| `version-control` | 3 | **Yes** — Canary pipeline incident, subagent dispatch trap | **Keep** |
| `master-analyst` | 0 (this run seeds it) | First run | **Keep** |

**Project skills** — `.claude/skills/`, 34 directories.

| Skill | Used? | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| `project-audit` | Yes — this run | **Keep.** Note its orphan-screen regex substring-matches (`NotificationsScreen` inside `NotificationsScreenV2`) and its import check misses relative imports — both produced false positives corrected below |
| `supabase`, `supabase-postgres-best-practices` | Directly relevant to a Supabase app | **Keep** |
| `ui-ux-pro-max` | Ships Flutter guidance | **Keep** |
| 22 × `agentdb-*`, `reasoningbank-*`, `swarm-*`, `v3-*`, `sparc-methodology`, `stream-chain`, `hooks-automation`, `pair-programming`, `verification-quality`, `skill-builder`, `browser` | No evidence of use | **Remove.** These are claude-flow's internal-development skills — building claude-flow v3, its DDD architecture, its MCP transport layer. Nothing in them applies to a Flutter app |
| 5 × `github-*` (`code-review`, `multi-repo`, `project-management`, `release-management`, `workflow-automation`) | Repo has no `.github/workflows/` | **Remove** unless CI is planned; `version-control` covers the release path today |

**Global skills** — `~/.claude/skills/`, 31 directories: the same claude-flow set, duplicated.
Every one of the 31 is either irrelevant to Flutter or shadowed by the project copy.
**Remove the duplication** — a project skill and a global skill with the same name is a
resolution ambiguity waiting to bite.

**Net:** 4/4 agents earn their place. 4 of 34 project skills are relevant; 30 are noise, and
they are duplicated 31× globally on top of that.

## 8. Incompleteness register

Every in-code admission of unfinished work, grouped by feature. Generated files
(`.g.dart`, `.freezed.dart`, `lib/l10n/app_localizations*.dart`) excluded.

### `core` — analytics (18 admissions, all in one file)
`lib/core/services/analytics/analytics_service.dart` — every public method is an empty body:
```
:11  // TODO: forward to underlying provider(s)
:22  // TODO: implement identify
:26  // TODO: implement reset
:35  // TODO: implement game creation step tracking
:51  // TODO: implement game created tracking
:68  // TODO: implement game joined tracking
:83  // TODO: implement game search tracking
:97  // TODO: implement filter usage tracking
:112 // TODO: implement check-in tracking
:128 // TODO: implement venue selection tracking
:141 // TODO: implement screen view tracking
:149 // TODO: implement feature usage tracking
:162 // TODO: implement error tracking
:177 // TODO: implement game engagement tracking
:192 // TODO: implement search result click tracking
:206 // TODO: implement check-in attempt tracking
:219 // TODO: implement performance metric tracking
```
Also `lib/core/services/auth_profile_service.dart:109` — `/// TODO: Migrate to use
ProfilesRepository.upsert instead`, and `lib/core/analytics/analytics_helpers.dart:160` —
`sportType: '', // TODO: Add sport type parameter`.

### `profile` (44 `UnimplementedError` sites — the largest cluster)
`lib/features/profile/data/repositories/settings_repository_impl.dart:14` states it outright:
> `/// (notifications, themes, accessibility, etc.) throw [UnimplementedError]`

then does it 26 times — lines `111, 117, 124, 130, 134, 139, 145, 152, 157, 163, 168, 174,
178, 182, 186, 190, 194, 201, 208, 213, 218, 226, 232, 237`.

`lib/features/profile/data/repositories/profile_stats_repository.dart` — 8 methods:
`:8 'ProfileStatsRepository.getProfileStats not implemented'`, and the same for
`updateProfileStats:18`, `incrementGamesPlayed:25`, `updateRating:36`,
`recordGameOutcome:48`, `getLeaderboardPosition:55`, `getProfileViews:62`,
`incrementProfileViews:69`.

`lib/features/profile/data/repositories/profile_repository.dart` — 10 methods:
`getUserProfile:17`, `updateProfile:77`, `createProfile:82`, `deleteProfile:87`,
`uploadProfileImage:93`, `searchProfiles:106`, `getProfilesByIds:113`,
`updateCompletionPercentage:123`, `getAllUserData:130`, `deleteAllUserData:137`.

`lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/settings/settings_screen.dart:1194` —
`} on UnimplementedError catch (_) {` (the UI absorbing all of the above).
`lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart:1046` —
`// TODO: Implement share profile`.
`lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/support/contact_support_screen.dart` — three
user-facing snackbars: `:388 'FAQ section coming soon'`, `:414 'Live chat coming soon'`,
`:441 'Phone call functionality coming soon'`.

### `rewards`
`lib/features/rewards/data/repositories/rewards_repository_impl.dart:40` —
`throw UnimplementedError('Not implemented');`
`lib/features/rewards/services/rewards_service_stub.dart:25` —
`throw UnimplementedError('UserProgress entity needs proper structure');`
`lib/features/rewards/services/rewards_service.dart:144` — `throw UnimplementedError(`
`lib/features/rewards/domain/repositories/rewards_repository.dart:355` —
`// Missing methods for tier_calculation_service.dart`
`lib/features/rewards/presentation/screens/rewards_analytics_dashboard.dart:1075, 1086, 1097`
— three dashboards whose entire body is `Text('… Dashboard - Coming Soon')`.
18 empty catch blocks across `progress_tracking_service.dart` (7),
`achievement_notification_service.dart` (2), `rewards_analytics_service.dart` (3),
`rewards_service.dart` (4), `tier_calculation_service.dart` (3).

### `auth_onboarding`
`lib/features/auth_onboarding/presentation/providers/auth_providers.dart:265` —
`throw UnimplementedError('AuthRepository not implemented');`
`:289` — `throw UnimplementedError('RegisterUseCase not implemented');` followed by the
commented-out real body.
`lib/features/auth_onboarding/data/services/ip_country_detection_service.dart:34` —
`// TODO: Disable JWT verification in Supabase dashboard for this function` (a config change
that was never made, sitting in code).
`lib/features/profile/services/onboarding_controller.dart` — 6 empty catches at
`:104, :160, :172, :190, :235, :317`; `onboarding_gamification.dart:46` — a 7th.

### `games`
`lib/features/games/providers/games_providers.dart:101, :118` — two whole use-case providers
commented out around `// throw UnimplementedError('BookingsRepository not yet implemented');`
`lib/features/games/data/repositories/bookings_repository_impl.dart:897` —
`return Left(UnknownFailure('QR code validation not implemented'));`
`lib/features/games/data/datasources/games_remote_data_source.dart:183` and
`games_repository_impl.dart:710` — `/// Returns 0.0 if no ratings exist or backend not implemented.`

### `social`
`lib/features/social/providers/community_providers.dart:183` —
`'totalPosts': 0, // TODO(post-rebuild): reconnect to PostRepository`

### `app` / `main`
`lib/main.dart:217` —
`// TODO(post-rebuild): reinitialize realtime post updates when new service is ready`
`lib/app/app_router.dart:590` — `Text('Language Selection - Coming Soon')`
`lib/app/app_router.dart:1715-1743` — `_PlaceholderScreen`, rendered on 6 routes
(`:1573, :1587, :1601, :1617, :1630, :1640`).

### `explore` / `misc` / `venues`
`lib/features/explore/presentation/screens/sports_screen.dart:2289` —
`// TODO: Navigate to add venue screen`
`lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/activities_screen_v2.dart:82` —
`// TODO: Navigate to detail screen based on subject_type and subject_id`
`lib/features/venues/presentation/screens/venue_detail_screen.dart:922` —
`void _shareVenue() => _snack('Sharing coming soon');`

### `design_system`
`lib/design_system/design_system.dart:1` —
`/// Single entrypoint for the app's (temporary) design-system layer.`
The word "temporary" has survived every refactor to date.

**Totals:** 26 strict `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK` comments · 44 `UnimplementedError` throw sites ·
9 user-visible "coming soon" strings · 44 empty catch blocks · 6 placeholder routes.
The two `TODO(post-rebuild)` markers name a rebuild that has not been finished.

## 9. Looks bad but is actually fine

Do not open tickets for these.

1. **Firebase `AIza…` keys** in `lib/firebase_options.dart:44,54,62,71,80` and
   `android/app/google-services.json:31`. These are **public client identifiers**, designed to
   ship in the binary. Not a leak.
2. **`service_role` in `supabase/functions/**`.** Appears at
   `send-push-notification/index.ts:15,219` and in the private-key handling of
   `broadcast-notification/index.ts:204`. Server-side Deno, correct. It does **not** appear
   anywhere in `lib/`.
3. **`spatial_ref_sys` flagged `rls_disabled_in_public` (ERROR).** PostGIS system table owned
   by the extension. You cannot enable RLS on it and it holds no app data.
4. **8 × `extension_in_public` warnings** (`postgis`, `citext`, `pg_trgm`, `btree_gin`,
   `btree_gist`, `cube`, `earthdistance`, `unaccent`). Supabase installs these into `public`
   by default; relocating them breaks every existing query. Ignore.
5. **300 + 299 `*_security_definer_function_executable` advisors.** That is one warning per
   role per `SECURITY DEFINER` function — the entire RPC layer, which is the deliberate
   architecture here (RLS-less tables reached through definer RPCs). These are not
   individually actionable. The **views** (SEC-01…06) are the real problem, not the functions.
6. **`notifications_screen_v2.dart` and `activities_screen_v2.dart`.** The `_v2` suffix reads
   like residue; both are the **live, routed** screens (`app_router.dart:95` / `:58`) and
   their v1 predecessors were deleted in `c74d6e1`. The scanner's substring match on
   `class NotificationsScreen…` inside `NotificationsScreenV2` produced a false orphan.
   The filenames should be renamed, but nothing is broken.
7. **`isAdmin` "client-side auth checks"** — 32 grep hits. Every gate that matters calls
   `Supabase.instance.client.rpc(SupabaseConfig.isAdminFn)` server-side
   (`app_router.dart:1673`, `:1699`, `moderation_queue_screen.dart:24`). The client is asking the
   server, not deciding for itself. Correct pattern.
8. **`SportsHistoryScreen` reported orphan.** The **class** is unreferenced, but the **file**
   has 3 importers (`sports_library_screen.dart:6`,
   `profile/presentation/widgets/sport_game_history_section.dart:5`,
   `games/providers/game_history_providers.dart:6`) which pull other symbols from it.
   Delete the class, keep the file.
9. **"143 god files."** 3 of those are generated l10n (`app_localizations.dart` 3,338,
   `_en` 1,826, `_ar` 1,786). Real count is **140**.
10. **`print()` in `lib/main.dart` (8 sites) and `lib/utils/logger.dart` (5).** These are
    zone-guard and error-handler paths where losing output would hide crashes. Worth
    converting to `debugPrint`, but not a leak or a bug.
11. **`authControllerProvider` / `registerControllerProvider` throw `UnimplementedError`.**
    They are also in the 113-provider orphan list — nothing watches them, so nothing crashes
    today. Still delete them (WIRE-05/06), but there is no live incident here.
12. **App hangs on the launch screen without `--dart-define-from-file=.env`.** Expected and
    documented. Not a bug.
13. **All 66 tests pass.** The tests themselves are well-written — parameterised, thorough on
    validation edges. The problem is what they point at, not their quality.
14. **`.env` hygiene is clean.** `git check-ignore .env` → ignored; `git ls-files .env` →
    not tracked. **0** hardcoded `.from('table')` calls and **0** hardcoded storage buckets
    remain in `lib/` — the `SupabaseConfig` migration (`5aee97e`, `a61d1d8`) actually landed.
15. **`raw MaterialPage` count: 0.** Every route uses a transition wrapper, exactly as
    `CLAUDE.md` requires.

## 10. Open questions for the PO

1. **Rewards: build or bury?** 20,545 LOC, unreachable, with a live flag advertising it.
   Every other rewards finding waits on this answer. (DEAD-01)
2. **The clean-architecture stack: is it the destination or the past?** `games`, `rewards`,
   and `profile/data` all contain complete layered implementations that no screen reaches,
   while the live code queries Supabase views and RPCs directly. Which is the target
   architecture? Answering it decides ~25% of `lib/`.
3. **`public.games` has no RLS policies.** Is the intent that all game access flows through
   `SECURITY DEFINER` views and RPCs? If yes, that is a valid design and should be written
   down — and the 5,674 LOC of direct-table code deleted. If no, policies are missing.
4. **Squads:** flag present, slice empty (136 LOC, 0 importers), `v_squad_card` /
   `v_squad_detail` views exist in the database. Was this cut, or is it next?
5. **Payments:** `lib/features/payments/` (503 LOC) has no importers, yet
   `FeatureFlags.enablePayments` gates 2 files elsewhere and `v_wallet_balance` /
   `v_user_balance` views exist. What is the live payment path?
6. **Migrations:** ~~`supabase/migrations/` is empty — no schema history~~ **CORRECTED 2026-08-27** — `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` holds **237 applied migrations**. The narrower open question: the repo cannot rebuild the schema (1 of 38 tracked `.sql` files has `CREATE TABLE`), so a fresh environment is not reproducible from source. The remote holds 184 tables and 336
   policies. Is schema history kept somewhere else, or has it never been captured?
7. **`dabbler_design_system`:** a git dependency with zero imports, alongside a local
   `lib/design_system/` that calls itself "temporary". Which one wins?
8. **The 6 "Coming Soon" routes** (Chat List, Messages, Social Notifications, Edit Post,
   Social Analytics, Language Selection): scheduled, or should the routes come out?
9. **Cloudflare Preview variables** — I cannot read them from the repo. Have all five
   (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `APP_NAME`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`)
   been confirmed present in **both** the Production and Preview environments since the last
   incident?

## 11. Handoff — who owns what

| Findings | Owner | First action |
|---|---|---|
| SEC-01 … SEC-06 | `notifications-specialist` | Owns the notification schema and RLS memory. Fix the two notification views (KAN-36/37) first, then triage the remaining 17 app views from the `SCHEMA.md` §2 census |
| SEC-07 … SEC-10, CFG-02 | `notifications-specialist` (DB scope) or a new `supabase-backend` agent | Policy triage on the 30 no-policy tables; baseline migration |
| BUG-01 … BUG-04 | `notifications-specialist` (DB) + a Flutter agent for the constants | Storage policies + bucket-name constants |
| DEAD-01 … DEAD-20, FLAG-01, FLAG-02, PROV-01, DEP-01, DEP-02 | A Flutter cleanup agent | Blocked on PO answers to Q1 and Q2 for rewards/games; the orphan screen files and `.broken` can go immediately |
| WIRE-01 … WIRE-11 | Feature agents per slice (profile, auth, games) | Start with WIRE-01/02 — it is a live user-facing failure |
| TEST-01, TEST-02 | A QA agent | First live-path test: `game_view_controller.dart` join/leave |
| ARCH-01 … ARCH-04, STYLE-01, STYLE-02, ERR-01 | Per-slice feature agents | Fold into whatever slice work happens next; do not run as a campaign |
| DOC-01 … DOC-04 | `master-analyst` | Refresh `NOTIFICATIONS.md`; correct the `CLAUDE.md` testing claim |
| CFG-01 | `version-control` | Verify Preview variables before the next Canary push |

## 12. Changelog

| Date | Run | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-29 | 1z (**backlog close-out — both NAV findings withdrawn, one real dead end found in their place**) | **Correcting my own run-1x navigation graph, which over-reported in the direction of alarm.** **NAV-02 withdrawn:** `onboarding_sports_screen.dart:194` reads `context.go(RoutePaths.createUserInfo)`, a declared route — `onboardingBasicInfo` appears nowhere in `lib/` outside `route_constants.dart` and left that file at `2523def`. **And it was never launch-critical:** `onboardingSports`→`onboardingPreferences`→`onboardingPrivacy`→`onboardingCompletion` is a closed four-screen cluster whose only inbound edges come from inside itself; the live chain runs `intent_selection`→`interests_selection`→`onboardingPrimarySport` and never enters it. Flagged by `flutter-feature-agent-5` and `task-auditor-11`, verified independently here. **NAV-01 withdrawn:** `social_search_screen.dart:1811` reads `context.push(RoutePaths.gameDetail(game.id))` and resolves. **NAV-01a is new and real:** `notifications_screen_v2.dart:518` pushes `/games/<id>` — the only remaining `/games/` literal in `lib/`, matching no route, on a live bottom-nav screen. Slice verdicts: `search` returns to **SHIPPED**, `notifications` moves to **PARTIAL**; totals unchanged at 12/6/1/6. **Root cause of both bad rows: the constant-name match and the `file:line` came from separate passes, so the cited line was never re-read.** Same class as the 14 false positives §14e already documents, but failing the other way. Also this run: §2a's three `CRITICAL/OPEN` labels struck (KAN-56 closed them; the resolution note was present but the rows still read OPEN). |
| 2026-08-29 | 1y (SEC-02/SEC-03 resolved · two loops closed) | **Both moderation-surface leaks are closed, and my urgent flag turned out to be a third confirmation of a fix already live.** KAN-56 shipped before my message landed. Re-verified as `anon`: **`v_mod_queue_open` and `v_safety_overview` raise `42501 permission denied`** — grant revoked, a stronger closure than zero rows; **`v_circle_feed` 0 rows** (was 6, private-circle posts) and `v_circle_feed_visible` 0, both invoker. Controls unchanged — `v_game_card` 216, `v_comments` 66. **The pre-flight I sent — revoke `v_mod_queue_open` rather than flip it, because both policies on `moderation_reports` deny SELECT — matched the ruling that had already shipped.** Recorded as independent confirmation. **It was still worth running:** had the migration flipped instead of revoked, the admin queue would have gone blank and the check would have caught it. **`kan27a`'s "applied by an unidentified actor" is closed too** — it was `cto` under `G-002`, traced through the Jira history by `team-lead` (KAN-27 comment 10166). Nothing for me to reconcile; the handoff in that file's header is discharged. **PO decision recorded: `INDEX.md` stays at `.claude/agent-memory/master-analyst/INDEX.md`** and is not moved or duplicated under `docs/`. KAN-44's acceptance criterion cites a path that does not exist and should be read as citing this one. |
| 2026-08-29 | 1x (inventory rework — KAN-40/41/42/44) | **Four inventory tickets reworked against `task-auditor`'s briefs.** **§14d** — full census of **102** screen/page/view classes with `file:line` and a per-class label: **73 ROUTED · 3 REACHED-BY-PUSH · 4 ORPHAN · 6 TRANSITIVELY DEAD · 16 PRIVATE HELPER**, method and script recorded. **102, not §13's 101** — the earlier matcher's definition was never written down, so the two are not comparable and I did not reconcile them by picking one. **§14e** — navigation graph diffed both directions. 90 declared routes vs 186 call sites. **31 declared-never-navigated** (URL-reachable on web, so discovery-bounded not access-bounded). **A naive name-based diff reported 16 dead ends; 14 were false positives** — path-builder functions, nested child routes, interpolation. **Two are genuine and both are live tap targets: NAV-01** (`social_search_screen.dart:1811` → `/games/<id>`, no such route) and **NAV-02** (`onboarding_sports_screen.dart:194` back button → `/onboarding-basic-info`, undeclared, on the launch-critical path). Bottom nav documented: **4 shell branches, 3 rendered** — the `community` branch has no item, and `RealFriendsScreen` is a working feature the bar cannot reach. **§15b** — hop-by-hop traces for the remaining 18 flows, entry → screen → provider → RPC/table. Three terminate in a placeholder and the trace says so rather than inventing a hop. **§20b** — slice verdicts re-judged: **12 SHIPPED · 6 PARTIAL · 1 SCAFFOLD · 6 DEAD**, three moved (`community` and `search` to PARTIAL on the new graph evidence). Nine SHIPPED slices re-checked and held. **`docs/INDEX.md` deliberately not created** — the artefact is `.claude/agent-memory/master-analyst/INDEX.md`; the AC cites the wrong path, and a second index would be a second authority. |
| 2026-08-29 | 1w (**§2a claimed a completeness it did not have — 3 CRITICAL views still leaking**) | **`task-auditor` reviewed KAN-19 against my own §2a heading and found it false.** §2a read *"RESOLVED — all twelve now have an explicit verdict, none is outstanding."* **Three views had no verdict row and were silently deferred to KAN-25 with no record of the deferral in §2a itself.** **The arithmetic gave it away and I did not check it:** 19 exposed − 2 PostGIS = 17 app views needing a verdict; my table covered 14. The three missing were exactly the gap, and they are the three worst in the section. **Re-measured as `anon` 2026-08-29, controls in the same transaction** (`v_notifications_feed` 0 ✓, `v_game_card` 216 ✓): **`v_mod_queue_open` returns 9 open reports carrying `reporter_username` and `target_username` — it deanonymises reporters to the people they reported**; **`v_circle_feed` returns 6 rows, all `visibility='circle'` in `circle_type='private'` — private circle posts, and not the `v_game_card` public-listing class**; `v_safety_overview` returns 1 aggregate row of the platform's moderation posture. **SEC-02 and SEC-03 are OPEN, not resolved, and flagged to `team-lead` to jump KAN-25's queue position.** They are the same class KAN-37/KAN-67 closed and were left behind by both. **The failure worth keeping: I wrote a completeness claim into a heading and never checked it against the count in the same section.** A summary line is a claim like any other — this one asserted resolution over three live CRITICALs and would have retired them. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1v (KAN-38b applied · five confirmed false positives · one count that needs care) | **Third ledger event. Migration `20260828194512` applied by `cto`; re-measured here.** `v_comments` redefined with **LEFT JOIN** `profiles` (was INNER) then both it and `v_post_comments` flipped to invoker. As `anon`: **`v_comments` 66 · `v_post_comments` 66 · 18 rows with a null author, present rather than vanished** — was 67, so **exactly 1 row closed, the genuine leak** (a comment on a non-public parent activity). Control `v_game_card` 216, unchanged. **Both regression checks hold after a second `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`:** 0 postgres-owned views grant write to `anon`/`authenticated`, and anon-readable views still **45** — read access moved from bypassing the policy to enforcing it **without changing who can reach the view.** **`T-027` adds five confirmed false positives to the register** — `username_registry_public` (backs signup username availability; must answer before a session exists), `geometry_columns` + `geography_columns` (`supabase_admin`-owned, not alterable by us per `T-025`), `v_potential_vibes_default` and `v_recreate_quickpicks` (function-backed — **`security_invoker` is a no-op when the `FROM` is a set-returning function**; access control lives inside the function). **So the 45 anon-readable views are not 45 outstanding findings.** I probed the two function-backed ones as `anon` rather than accepting the mechanism argument: **both return 0 rows.** **One number to state carefully:** `cto` reported "postgres-owned invoker views now 6". Six is the count of views **flipped today** (`security_invoker=on`); **the invoker population is 28** — 6 written `=on` today plus 22 pre-existing `=true`. Both true, different things; my census carries **28**. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1u (KAN-37 applied · **my census query was broken and would have hidden it**) | **Second ledger event today. Re-measured, and the re-measurement found a defect in my own instrument rather than in the migration.** Migration `20260828193807` applied by `cto`. Verified: **anon-readable views 48 → 45**, exactly the three SELECT revokes · as `anon`, `v_notifications_feed` and `v_notifications_ranked` return **0 rows** (were 611 across 51 users) and `v_user_reputation` 0 · controls unchanged in the same transaction (`v_meetup_list` 1, `v_game_card` 216), so **no cascade** · **SEC-01, the run-1 CRITICAL, is RESOLVED.** **The regression check `cto` asked for holds: KAN-67's posture survived a `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`** — 0 postgres-owned views grant write to `anon` or `authenticated`. That was the one way KAN-67 could have quietly reopened. **And my census query was wrong.** It tested `option_value = 'true'` for `security_invoker`; this migration wrote `security_invoker=on`. **Postgres accepts `on`/`true`/`yes`/`1` as the same boolean**, so my query read all four newly-flipped views as still definer — **it would have reported a real remediation as not applied**, and I would have told the PO the fix had not landed. Corrected to `option_value::boolean`. Corrected census: **71 total · 26 invoker · 45 definer · 20 definer-and-anon-granted.** The earlier 22-invoker figure was right on 2026-08-27 only because every view then in the file had been written `=true`. `SCHEMA.md` §2e rewritten with both defects named. **KAN-38 is NOT resolved and must not be recorded as such** — three things remain open on it: the `v_comments`/`v_post_comments` slice `cto` rejected (the invoker flip drops 19 of 67 rows for `anon`, 18 of them to `profiles.is_active=false` through an INNER JOIN; **only 1 is the leak**, so it is blocked on a `cpo` decision about deactivated profiles' comments); the five intentionally-public views still need their `T-027` entry; and `v_space_slots_today` is broken independent of security — BUG-05 — `find_slots()` references the dropped `public.venue_opening_hours` and errors for every role including `postgres`. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1t (bound corrected upward · no QA gate exists) | **Two corrections, and the first moves in the record's favour — which is why it needed making as much as an unfavourable one would.** I recorded SEC-16's closure as "mechanism-verified; no insert was attempted, by anyone". **`cto` did attempt one:** step 5 of the KAN-67 verification issued a real `INSERT` through `v_notifications_feed` as `anon` and the database refused it with `insufficient_privilege`. **The deny path is observation-verified on that view**, and the entry was underselling what was tested — the first thing anyone challenging SEC-16 will ask is whether someone actually tried it. Corrected to: **exercised on `v_notifications_feed`, mechanism-verified on the remaining six**, with the reason the other six must not be exercised (`auth.users`; `pg_net` push, which no rollback undoes). Side-effect check run independently here: `notifications` is at **612 rows**, +1 in six hours — a genuine `auth.welcome` for a real signup, not the probe. **Verified before raising it rather than after.** **Second: per `T-026`, nothing on this project runs `flutter analyze` or `flutter test` automatically.** `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` runs `flutter pub get` and a build, no analyze and no test; `scripts/cloudflare-build.sh` checks four env vars and nothing else; **`scripts/run_integration_tests.sh` is invoked by nothing** — zero references anywhere, hand-run only per its own usage comment. My file inventory called all three "live build/release entry points"; **that was true of two of them.** Corrected. **No promotion may be described as QA-verified until a QA seat exists and KAN-72 lands** (`T-026`, `DECISIONS.md:2648` — `cto`'s prefix, not `G-`; **`G-003` is the hiring decision and I mis-cited it here for two hours**) — the `flutter analyze: 0 errors` figure in the run-1 baseline is a measurement I took by hand, not evidence of a gate. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1s (KAN-67 applied — SEC-16 partially resolved) | **The highest-severity finding on the board is closed on its main path, and I verified the post-state rather than recording the report.** `cto` applied migration `20260828160122` and sent the ledger event per G-002. Re-measured against `wtncuzcskpigqpmnxwws`: **anon/authenticated write on postgres-owned views is 0** (was 70 of 71 granted); all seven live write paths false on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE; **`pg_default_acl` grantor `postgres` now `anon=rxtm`**, so the generative half — the reason a REVOKE-only fix would have regressed — is closed. **`anon_readable_views = 48`, unchanged.** That is the number that mattered most: `SCHEMA.md` §1a warned that touching the read mechanism would blank the app, and it did not move. **Recorded as RESOLVED (PARTIAL), not RESOLVED**, with four exclusions stated in the entry so a later reader cannot infer more than was done: 184 of 184 base tables still grant write; the `supabase_admin` default-privilege rule is not executable from this project's roles; the two PostGIS views stay writable by design; TRIGGER/REFERENCES remain. **Bound: mechanism-verified, not observation-verified** — the privilege is gone, no insert was attempted by anyone, and none should be (`DECISIONS.md` 019). `T-018` part (3)'s FORCE RLS call is superseded by `T-025`; the revoked grant was the whole fix. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1r (FORCE RLS struck from the fix — the mechanism was misattributed) | **`cto` corrected the bypass mechanism for all seven views and it removes a part of the remediation I had called load-bearing.** I attributed six of the seven to owner-equals-owner and excluded only `auth.users` from the FORCE RLS fix on `rolbypassrls` grounds. **The exclusion is universal.** Verified independently: **all seven app views are owned by `postgres`** (`geometry_columns` is owned by `supabase_admin`), and **`postgres` has `rolbypassrls = true`** — checked ahead of the owner/FORCE logic, so FORCE changes nothing on any of them. Demonstrated rather than cited, on a table that already has FORCE set: `public.sport_profiles` (`relforcerowsecurity = true`, owner `postgres`) shows **138 rows visible, 131 admitted by its policies** — 7 rows no policy admits. **Note the margin: 7, not 138.** `cto` flagged its own near-miss here — a first version tested only the `p.user_id = auth.uid()` policy and read 138 vs 0, ignoring the permissive `p.is_active = true` policy that admits 131. The corrected margin is smaller and still decisive. **SEC-16's fix is two parts, not three: REVOKE plus `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`. Severity unchanged.** **Two further measurements adopted, both verified:** `pg_has_role('postgres','supabase_admin','MEMBER') = false`, so **the `supabase_admin` half of the default-privileges revoke is not executable from this project's roles**, and neither is a REVOKE on the `supabase_admin`-owned `geometry_columns` — "both grantors" stays the correct end state, one of the two is unreachable and needs a PO decision. And **all 184 base tables in `public` grant `anon` or `authenticated` write** — deliberately out of KAN-67's scope because those are RLS-constrained, but **"KAN-67 applied" must not be recorded as closing the wide grant.** |
| 2026-08-28 | 1q (invoker conversion narrowed — and it leaves the gate) | **The 1p constraint exposed a conflict between two of `cto`'s own decisions, and following either one alone would have blanked the app.** One said flip the definer views to `security_invoker`, adding base-table policies first so screens don't blank; the other said the 30 zero-policy tables are served through the definer funnel **by design** and rejected adding policies to them. The first's safety step is what the second rejects. Policy counts re-verified here: **`games` 0 · `content_drafts` 0 · `user_hidden_modes` 0** · `user_reputation_aggregate` 1 · `meetups` 2 · `notifications` 4 · `posts` 5 · `profiles` 13. **`v_game_card` reads `games`**, so flipping it returns zero rows to every user, signed in or not, on the most-used surfaces first. **Ruling adopted: a definer view over a zero-policy base table stays definer.** The invoker conversion applies only to views whose base tables carry real policies. **Refinement added here: a non-zero policy count is necessary but not sufficient** — `notifications` has 4 policies of which the only INSERT one is `WITH CHECK (false)`; a count says nothing about whether the policies serve the read pattern the view depends on. Check the policies, don't just count them. **Gate effect: the invoker conversion stops being a promotion blocker in its own right** and becomes a later, smaller correctness item over policy-carrying tables only. The blocker remains the revoke plus FORCE RLS where the executing role does not bypass it. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1p (definer funnel confirmed deliberate) | **`cto` found client-side corroboration for a database-side measurement, and it constrains the SEC-16 fix.** `game_composer_screen.dart:205-207` carries a doc comment stating *"the raw `games` table is not client-readable (RLS with no policies)"* — so the app routes reads through `v_game_card` **by design**, written down by whoever built it. Verified: `select count(*) from public.games` as `anon` returns 0. **Two independent sources — the `prosrc` measurement and the source comment — one conclusion: the definer funnel is architecture, not drift.** **The constraint that follows:** the SEC-16 remediation must preserve the read path. Converting these views to `security_invoker` to "fix" the bypass would blank the app, because the base tables have no policies and an invoker view would return nothing. **Revoke the write grants; do not touch the read mechanism.** Recorded in `SCHEMA.md` §1a. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1o (`cto`'s open question closed) | **`cto` handed over a marked-UNVERIFIED gap rather than a third number, and closing it took one command.** It had found that `.from(vGameCardTable)` has **8** call sites, not the 3 we had scoped, with the other five gated behind `select(...)` constants it had not expanded — and declined to guess after being wrong twice by stopping one level early. Expanded all five (`_historyColumns`, `_cardColumns`, and three inline lists): **none names `creator_user_id`. The 3-site scope stands.** **The expansion did find what the column lists conceal: two sites call bare `.select()`**, which returns every column — so `creator_user_id` reaches `game_composer_screen.dart:213`, which never reads it. Exposure surface for SEC-17, not migration scope. **Method note for the catalogue:** `.from()` says who reads the view and `select()` says who reads the column, **but a bare `.select()` reads every column** — so the column-list axis has a wildcard case, and an audit that greps `select(` lists will miss exactly the sites that take everything. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1n (SEC-17 scope settled — the axis is target, not syntax) | **`cto` proposed that 6 and 3 are both right counting different things. They are not, and the reconciliation mislabels the two sites that matter least.** `cto` grouped by *syntax* — 3 "query-filter sites" vs 2 deserialize — and called the filter group "the ones that break if the column is dropped". **Two of those three filter the `games` table, not the view** (`sport_profile_view_provider.dart:264` → `.from(gamesTable)` at `:262`; `supabase_games_datasource.dart:507` → `.from(gamesTable)` at `:505`), and **`creator_user_id` exists on the `games` table**, so they are untouched by a view change. **The axis that decides scope is the query target, not the call syntax.** Settled figures: **6 raw occurrences · 5 files · 3 sites read `v_game_card` · exactly 1 of those is a filter on the view** (`game_history_providers.dart:79-80`), which is the silently-wrong-results site. **Two real additions from `cto`, both verified:** the Dart-side propagation — `creatorUserId` returns **6** more occurrences, including `game_detail_screen.dart:648-653` where the identity is **routed** (`'${RoutePaths.userProfile}/$creatorUserId'`), so a migration changes a route argument and not just a parse. **And its `host_user_id` migration-path hypothesis is dead, which it correctly declined to assert:** `host_user_id` exists on **neither** `games` **nor** `v_game_card`, so `game_model.dart:81`'s `?? json['host_user_id']` branch can never fire — the parser degrades straight to `''`. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1m (SEC-17 call sites corrected 6 → 3) | **`cto` caught its own overstatement and mine inherited it.** SEC-17 was scoped against "6 `creator_user_id` read sites". Verified here: **3**. Two of the six query the `games` **table**, not the view, and a view change does not touch them (`sport_profile_view_provider.dart:264`, `supabase_games_datasource.dart:507` — both `.from(gamesTable)`). **A grep count read as a call-site count**, the same instrument error as the `pg_depend` artefact: it answered *where does this string appear*, not *what breaks*. **Exactly one of the three is a filter on the view** (`game_history_providers.dart:79-80` → `.from(vGameCardTable)` at `:84`) and it is the dangerous one — a silently wrong game history. My earlier entry said two filters; on the view there is one. **Four competing identity columns, not two:** `host_user_id` 23 refs · `creator_user_id` 6 · `organizer_id` 4 · **`creator_profile_id` 1** — the migration target has a single reference in the whole app, which sizes the job as establishing an identity rather than swapping a column. `game_model.dart:81` already reconciles two behind an `?? ''` default, a silent-failure vector of the same shape as the blocklist returning 0. **Ruling unchanged — do not fold — and it now rests on a smaller, firmer number.** |
| 2026-08-28 | 1l (`v_needs_organiser` target established — `auth.users`) | **The one thing I refused to assert turned out worse than the guess I refused to make.** I left `v_needs_organiser`'s insert target UNESTABLISHED because my `pg_depend` walk could not separate a `FROM` relation from a subquery reference, and noted `profiles` would be the worst target. `cto` read the view definition: the target is **`auth.users`**; `profiles` appears only inside the `NOT EXISTS`. Re-verified here. **It bypasses by a second, distinct mechanism.** `auth.users` is owned by `supabase_auth_admin`, so owner-equals-owner does not apply — but `postgres` has **`rolbypassrls = true`** and INSERT on the table, reaching the same outcome. **`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` does not close it; `rolbypassrls` defeats FORCE.** Only the revoke does — which is why `v_needs_organiser` goes into the first REVOKE ahead of the notification views, and it is free to close: 0 client references. Added here: `auth.users` has RLS enabled with **zero policies** (a deny-all) that `rolbypassrls` walks past, and an insert would fire **two enabled triggers**, so the row would not be inert. Exploitability stays UNESTABLISHED and the finding is stated as *a write path onto the identity table*, never as account creation. **`SCHEMA.md` §11 check #4 amended** — "does RLS actually execute" must test `relforcerowsecurity` **and** `rolbypassrls` on the executing role, or it passes this case. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1k (SEC-17 sequencing overruled) | **`cto` overruled my recommendation to fold SEC-17 into KAN-67; verified and adopted.** I argued bundling because it is the same file and the same review. The evidence inverts it: **all 8 anon-writable views have zero Dart references**, which makes KAN-67 the only verifiably risk-free production change in the plan — the exact property that lets it be waved through in minutes while a destructive hole is open. **SEC-17 touches 6 `creator_user_id` read sites, two of them query filters**, so it is a coordinated Dart + SQL change and would have dragged the revoke behind the missing Flutter owner. "Same file, same review" was the argument *against* folding, not for it. Added here beyond `cto`'s case: the two filter sites fail as **silently wrong results** rather than as errors, and `creator_profile_id` is a different identity from the auth `userId` the call sites pass — so this is an identity-model migration per site, not a column rename. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1j (SEC-16 widened — the write hole is project-wide and self-healing in the wrong direction) | **`cto` measured AC#5 and it changes the fix, not just the size.** Re-measured here, every figure reproduces: of 71 views **70 grant `anon` INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE · 19 are auto-updatable · all 19 carry the grant · 8 are definer + auto-updatable + anon-writable** (7 app views + `geometry_columns`, the known PostGIS artefact). **Root cause is `pg_default_acl`:** `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` in `public` from **both** `postgres` and `supabase_admin` grants `anon`/`authenticated` `arwdDxtm` on every relation created — inherited Supabase stock configuration, never authored here and never turned off. `storage` carries it too. **Consequence: a REVOKE-only migration passes its own verification query and then silently regresses on the next `CREATE VIEW`.** The fix must include `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES … REVOKE` for both grantors. **Extension found here, beyond `T-018`:** walking each writable view to its base tables shows **all 7 base tables have `relforcerowsecurity = false`**, so every one bypasses RLS by the same owner path — and **`v_notifications_ranked` is a second, previously unrecorded entry to `notifications` and therefore to the push trigger.** Six views have a single base table so their write target is unambiguous; **`v_needs_organiser` resolves to two (`profiles`, `users`) and its insert target is deliberately left UNESTABLISHED.** `cto` also superseded its own `T-017` "only one view carries the integrity risk" — it had generalised from the three views the `cpo` happened to name. Same population error both of us made this morning, one layer up. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1i (SEC-15 split) | **The CTO ruled on this twice in separate passes and reached the same split both times: severity attaches to the column, not the view.** SEC-15 narrowed to **MED** for the discovery exposure — display name, avatar, `start_at`, venue name, on rows the organiser marked public, with no coordinates or contact details; a discovery app must show public games to a logged-out browser. **`creator_user_id` split out as SEC-17 at HIGH**, then scoped past the one view they raised: sweeping every anon-granted definer view for an `auth.users`-shaped uuid and probing each as `anon` gives **61 distinct real `auth.users` UUIDs readable with no account — 25% of the 240-user base** — across five views. The notification views were already known leaks, **but only their row counts had ever been counted; the uid column itself was never a finding.** Eight further views carry such a column and currently return zero rows. The reusable rule, `cto`'s words: **a view can be correctly public and still carry one field that has no business in it** — grading a view as a unit is the same shape as the grant/predicate error, one level down. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1h (write path found) | **`cto` found a write path into `notifications` that reaches push delivery with no account, and I verified every link of it against the live catalogue.** Filed as **SEC-16, CRITICAL, now the highest item on the board** — the audit had treated the definer-view problem as a *confidentiality* problem for two runs, and it is also an *integrity and delivery* problem. `v_notifications_feed` is `is_insertable_into = YES` with `anon` holding INSERT; `n_block_insert WITH CHECK (false)` exists but is never evaluated because view and table are both owned by `postgres`, the view is not `security_invoker`, and `relforcerowsecurity = false`; `trg_push_on_notification_insert` then posts attacker-controlled `title`/`body` to the trusted `x-trigger-secret` endpoint for an attacker-chosen `to_user_id`. Neither of us attempted the insert. **Correction adopted from `cto`, narrowing my record:** only **one** view is writable — `v_mod_queue_open` and `v_safety_overview` are `is_insertable_into = NO`, because aggregates are not auto-updatable. They keep the same wide grants and stay confidentiality-only. **And a correction to `cto`:** its "23 of 29 push-enabled" was read from a `push_enabled` column that does not exist on `notification_kinds`; the real columns are `default_channels` and `is_active`. The number is right anyway — 23 of 29 active kinds carry `push` in `default_channels` — but the derivation must be recorded correctly or the check is not reproducible. |
| 2026-08-28 | 1g (view census re-probe) | **`cto` challenged the 19 with a count of 27; both numbers were wrong and mine was wrong in the more dangerous direction.** Re-measured against `wtncuzcskpigqpmnxwws`: **71 views · 49 definer · 22 invoker · 27 definer-and-anon-granted.** `cto`'s 27 is a *privilege* count, not an *exposure* count — 6 of the 27 return zero rows to `anon`, so 27 overstates the leak. But probing the remaining 8 broke my own bucket: **`v_game_card` returns 216 rows to `anon` and `v_meetup_list` returns 1.** I had filed all 8 as "safe by `auth.uid()` predicate" **on a text match against the view definition, never having queried them.** They are filtered by `listing_visibility = 'public'`, not by `auth.uid()` — right outcome for the row set, wrong mechanism in my record, and two views I called safe are readable. Not promoted to the §2a leak class: every row returned is marked public. Filed instead as **SEC-15 (MED)** on the column set — unauthenticated callers get `creator_user_id`, username, display name, avatar, start time and venue. `SCHEMA.md` §2b rewritten with per-view row counts and a control query. Also adopted from `cto` after independent verification: **DEAD-21** (`data_export_service.dart`, 2,092 LOC, zero importers) and **DEAD-22** (`lib/core/analytics/` unimported, two classes named `AnalyticsService`, one emission site). `cto`'s `pg_stat_statements_info` item did **not** verify — it exists in the `extensions` schema and nothing in `public` references it; logged as a false positive. |
| 2026-08-27 | 1f (WIRE-09 re-correction) | **My own correction was wrong, in the direction of relief.** Yesterday's 1d pass downgraded WIRE-09 to LOW on the claim that *all six* placeholder routes are orphans. **Five are. `socialChat` is not.** A live, unconditional Message button on every user profile (`user_profile_screen.dart:1094` → `:1475`) pushes it, and its `FeatureFlags.messaging` guard is open (`feature_flags.dart:53 = true`), so the user lands on "Coming Soon". This contradicted `INDEX.md` §11b's own INV-01, which was right, and the blanket claim would have retired a real `cpo` blocker (B4). Caught by `cpo`, verified independently here. **WIRE-09 restored to MED** with the population corrected to **7 placeholder routes · 1 reachable · 6 orphans**, and with the further finding that **no placeholder route is behind a closed flag** — the two that carry guards have open ones. Two new defects on the same path adopted from `cpo`: BUG-07 (`whenData` swallows loading/error, button does nothing) and BUG-08 (`substring(0, 8)` `RangeError` on a short URL id). |
| 2026-08-27 | 1e (severity re-sort) | **SEC-11 downgraded CRITICAL → HIGH; SEC-13 promoted to CRITICAL.** The keystore bound was verified independently by the CTO and me and is stronger than first stated: **no signing artifact has ever existed in the repo on any ref, and Android signing never runs in CI** — so a credential is exposed and the artifact is not. SEC-13 promoted on the interaction the original assessment missed: passwordless signup makes an account free, so **launch scales the attacker pool and the target pool at once.** Exposure window for SEC-11 now verified at 9 months (`ebaf9b8`, 2025-11-22). |
| 2026-08-27 | 1d (attribution audit) | **WIRE-10 was wrong and the error reached a launch-gate P0 before anyone caught it.** `:590` is `/language_selection` — an orphan route — not `/settings/language`, which is at `:1287` and renders a working 226-line screen. **Language switching works today.** The `cpo` sourced the claim from this record, as its definition instructs, and escalated MED → P0 without opening the screen; it has retracted. **Re-checked every sibling `WIRE-` entry that names a route or line, which is how WIRE-09 was caught: all six of its placeholder routes are also orphans** — every owning `RoutePaths` constant is referenced only by its own declaration. Both downgraded to LOW with disposition *delete the dead route*. WIRE-02/05/06/11 line citations re-verified and hold. |
| 2026-08-27 | 1c (cto reconciliation) | **CTO ran an independent pass (KAN-39/KAN-64) and we converged on the leak, the 19-view population, `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` — measured separately before either read the other.** Four deltas resolved: 143 vs 140 god files (mine excludes generated l10n — CTO agreed, `T-010`); **STYLE-01 corrected 233 → 317 with the command recorded**, because 233 was reproducible only under a filter I never wrote down; **ARCH-03 expanded — three error conventions, not two**, incl. a hand-written `Either` in `lib/core/utils/either.dart` used by 13 files and not fpdart-compatible; decision 010 held but STYLE-03 added for 13 `MaterialPageRoute` sites. **Six new findings adopted after independent verification:** SEC-11 keystore plaintext, SEC-12 logout leaves FCM token, SEC-13 push authz, SEC-14 Android Auto Backup, BUG-05 `v_space_slots_today` 42P01, BUG-06 assetlinks placeholder. PostGIS views marked do-not-re-flag in SEC-06. |
| 2026-08-27 | 1b (corrections) | **Two findings corrected after independent review.** SEC-06 understated the definer-view problem ~2×: **71 views / 49 definer / 19 anon-exposed**, not 49/25/8 — the original took the Supabase advisor's finding count for a population count, and 11 exposed views went unexamined as a result. Severity raised to **CRITICAL**. CFG-02 corrected **twice**: `supabase/migrations/` does not exist *and* `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` holds **237 applied migrations** — the surviving finding is reproducibility (1 of 38 tracked `.sql` files has `CREATE TABLE`), not missing history. Live leaks re-filed as KAN-36/37/38. New governance: DECISIONS 019 (no agent writes production), 020 + MANIFESTO R15 (count populations, never infer). `SCHEMA.md` §2 now carries a per-view anon-exposure position for all 71 views. |
| 2026-08-26 | 1 (baseline) | First audit. 25 slices classified: 12 SHIPPED · 6 PARTIAL · 1 SCAFFOLD · 6 DEAD. 62 findings logged (10 security, 20 dead code, 11 incompleteness, 4 bugs, 2 tests, 4 architecture, 2 style, 2 dependency, 4 docs, 2 config, 1 provider). **CRITICAL:** unauthenticated read of 609 notifications across 49 users via `v_notifications_feed`/`v_notifications_ranked`; moderation queue and safety overview equally open. Headline numbers: 98/113 dead flags · 113/400 orphan providers · 21 orphan screen classes / 6,213 LOC in 10 files · 140 non-generated files >500 LOC · 22/25 features with no test dir · 5 test files vs 783 lib files (all 66 tests cover unreachable code) · 31 `Either` vs 124 `Result` files · 233 hardcoded colours · 26 `print()` · 44 empty catches · 44 `UnimplementedError` sites · 54/133 unused route constants · 0 migration files. `flutter analyze`: 0 errors. |

# PART II — APPLICATION INVENTORY

**Inventory run:** 2026-08-27 · **Branch:** `Canary` · **HEAD:** `5f92904`
**Scope:** the shipped application surface — every screen, every flow, every affordance.
**Method:** static reachability only. No runtime testing, no manual QA. Three measures are
used and must not be confused:

1. **Import-reachable** — a file-level BFS over `import`/`export`/`part` edges starting at
   `lib/main.dart`. A file outside this set is not compiled into the app at all.
2. **Route-referenced** — the screen class appears in `lib/app/app_router.dart`.
3. **UI-reachable** — some widget the user can actually see navigates there.

A screen can be route-referenced and still never reachable by tapping. **Dabbler ships as
Flutter Web on Cloudflare Pages (`app.dabbler.pro`), so every registered route path is
reachable by typing a URL**, whether or not a button points at it. That distinction is
load-bearing for several findings below.

Reproduce: `/Users/moatazmustapha/.claude/jobs/*/tmp/reach.py` (import BFS) and
`census.sh` (class census).

## 13. The headline number

**69,612 lines across 267 non-generated Dart files are not import-reachable from
`lib/main.dart`.** They are in the repository and not in the app.

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Dart files under `lib/` | 835 (incl. generated) |
| Import-reachable from `main.dart` | 558 |
| **Unreachable, non-generated** | **267 files / 69,612 LOC** |
| Screen/page/view classes | 101 |
| — referenced in `app_router.dart` | 74 |
| — pushed from a routed screen, not routed themselves | 2 (`SavedLocationsScreen`, `SportsLibraryScreen`) |
| — orphaned public screens | 7 |
| — private helper views (`_ErrorView`, `_EmptyView`, …) | 18 |
| `GoRoute` declarations | 90 |
| `RoutePaths` constants | 99 declared · **21 referenced nowhere** |
| `RouteNames` constants | 96 declared · **44 referenced nowhere** |

**Correction to run 1.** The baseline logged "21 orphan screen classes / 6,213 LOC in 10
files" and "54/133 unused route constants". Both were narrower measures than the population.
The dead surface is **~11× larger** than the orphan-screen figure suggested, and the route
constants are **195 declared / 65 unused**, not 133/54.

## 14. Screen inventory

### 14a. Orphaned public screens — 7

Zero references outside their own file, not import-reachable.

| Screen | File | LOC |
|---|---|---:|
| `CreatePostScreen` | `lib/features/social/presentation/screens/create_post_screen.dart:21` | 1,196 |
| `ExploreNearbyScreen` | `lib/features/explore/presentation/screens/explore_nearby_screen.dart:22` | 864 |
| `CreateGameScreen` | `lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/create_game_screen.dart:16` | 763 |
| `GamesNearbyScreen` | `lib/features/games/presentation/screens/games_nearby_screen.dart:22` | 722 |
| `VenuesNearbyScreen` | `lib/features/venues/presentation/screens/venues_nearby_screen.dart:23` | 619 |
| `SportsHistoryScreen` | `lib/features/explore/presentation/screens/sports_history_screen.dart:102` | — |
| `FavoriteVenuesScreen` | `lib/features/explore/presentation/screens/sports_screen.dart:1782` | — |

`CreatePostScreen` is **superseded, not missing**: the live composer is
`PostComposerScreen` (`lib/features/social/presentation/screens/post_composer_screen.dart`,
2,996 LOC), routed at `lib/app/app_router.dart:1376-1386`. Two full post composers exist;
one is wired.

### 14b. Routes that render a placeholder — 6

`_PlaceholderScreen` (`lib/app/app_router.dart:1715-1745`) renders a construction icon and
the text **"<title>\nComing Soon"**.

| Route | Line | Linked from live UI? |
|---|---|---|
| `socialChat/:userId` — "Chat: …" | `app_router.dart:1617` | **YES** — see 16a |
| `socialChatList` — "Chat List" | `app_router.dart:1573` | no |
| `socialMessages` — "Messages" | `app_router.dart:1601` | no |
| `socialNotifications` — "Social Notifications" | `app_router.dart:1587` | no |
| `socialEditPost` — "Edit Post" | `app_router.dart:1630` | no |
| `socialAnalytics` — "Social Analytics" | `app_router.dart:1640` | no |

A seventh construction screen is inlined directly in the router:
`/language_selection` → `Text('Language Selection - Coming Soon')`
(`lib/app/app_router.dart:590`).

### 14c. Route-registered but no UI navigates there — 31 `RoutePaths`

Reachable by URL on web, invisible in the app. Includes `rewards`, `adminModerationQueue`,
`adminSafetyOverview`, `socialEditPost`, `socialAnalytics`, `register`,
`onboardingPersonaSelection`, and the four `socialOnboarding*` screens. The tab routes
(`community`, `venuesTab`, `gamesTab`, `sportsExplore`, `activities`) are **not** in this
category despite appearing router-only — they are entered via
`StatefulNavigationShell.goBranch(index)`
(`lib/features/home/presentation/screens/main_navigation_screen.dart:219-236`), which is
correct and not a finding.

## 14d. FULL SCREEN CENSUS — every screen/page/view class, 2026-08-29

*Added for KAN-40. §14a/14b/14c below listed only the exceptions; this is the complete
enumeration the ticket asked for. **The exception lists are kept — they carry reasoning this
table does not** — but this table is the authority on classification.*

**Method, stated so the number is reproducible.** Class declarations in `lib/**` whose name
ends `Screen`, `Page` or `View`, excluding `*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart` and `lib/l10n/**`;
cross-referenced against constructor references in `lib/app/app_router.dart` (ROUTED, with the
nearest enclosing `path:` constant), against references from any other file (REACHED-BY-PUSH),
and against a file-level import BFS from `lib/main.dart` (TRANSITIVELY DEAD). Script:
`$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR/tmp/census.py` — recreate it; job dirs are cleaned up.

| Label | Count | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| **ROUTED** | **73** | Constructed in `app_router.dart` under a `GoRoute` |
| **REACHED-BY-PUSH** | **3** | Never in the router; constructed from another live file |
| **ORPHAN** | **4** | No reference outside its own file, but the file *is* import-reachable |
| **TRANSITIVELY DEAD** | **6** | No external reference **and** the file is import-unreachable from `main.dart` |
| **PRIVATE HELPER** | **16** | `_`-prefixed, private to its own file — not app surface |
| **Total** | **102** | |

**This is 102, not the 101 in §13.** The earlier figure came from a different matcher whose
definition I did not record, so the two are not comparable and I am not going to reconcile them
by picking one. **102 is the number with a method attached; 101 is a memory.** The same rule
that retired the 233-colour figure applies here to my own count.

**One caveat on the matcher, stated rather than silently filtered:** it keys on the class-name
suffix, so `GameView` (`game_view_controller.dart:103`) is counted — it is a controller state
class, not a screen. Renaming it out of the census would be tidier and less honest; it is
listed as REACHED-BY-PUSH, which is what it measurably is.

**Import-reachability:** 556 of 776 non-generated `.dart` files under `lib/` are reachable from
`main.dart`. The 220-file remainder is the population §13's 267-file figure was measuring under
a different exclusion set — again, two methods, and only this one has its script recorded.

## 14e. NAVIGATION GRAPH — declared routes vs actual call sites, 2026-08-29

*Added for KAN-41. The diff runs in both directions.*

**Method.** Every `path:` expression in `lib/app/app_router.dart` (90 declarations); every
`context.go / push / goNamed / pushNamed / replace / pushReplacement` call site across `lib/**`
(**186 outside the router** — 90 `go`, 84 `push`, 12 `pushNamed`; **zero** `goNamed`, `replace`
or `pushReplacement`). Script: `$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR/tmp/navgraph.py`.

### Direction 1 — declared but never navigated to

**31 route constants** are declared as a `GoRoute` path and appear at no navigation call site:

`aboutPrivacy` · `aboutTerms` · `activities` · `addPersonaWelcome` · `adminModerationQueue` ·
`adminSafetyOverview` · `community` · `createGameBasicInfo` · `editGame` · `emailVerification` ·
`error` · `followers` · `following` · `hashtagFeed` · `myVenueSubmissions` ·
`onboardingInterestsSelection` · `postComposer` · `register` · `resetPassword` · `rewards` ·
`social` · `socialAnalytics` · `socialChatList` · `socialEditPost` · `socialFeed` ·
`socialMessages` · `socialNotifications` · `socialOnboardingComplete` ·
`socialOnboardingNotifications` · `socialOnboardingWelcome` · `sportsExplore`

**This is discovery-bounded, not access-bounded.** Dabbler ships as Flutter Web, so every one
of these is reachable by typing the URL. `error` and `emailVerification` are reached by the
framework rather than by a call site and are not defects.

### Direction 2 — navigated to but matching no declared route

**A naive diff reports 16. Fourteen are false positives and I nearly shipped them.** Comparing
*constant names* against *declared constants* misses three legitimate patterns:

- **Path-builder functions.** `RoutePaths.gameDetail(game.id)` is a `static String` function
  (`route_constants.dart:89`) returning `/sports/games/$gameId`, which **is** declared
  (`app_router.dart:829`). Same for `venueDetail` (`:90` → `:864`) and `venueSubmissionDetail`
  (`:85`).
- **Nested child routes.** `/venue-submissions/create` never appears as a literal — it is the
  child `path: 'create'` (`app_router.dart:1005`) under parent `RoutePaths.myVenueSubmissions`
  (`:987`).
- **Interpolation.** `'${RoutePaths.socialChat}/:conversationId'` resolves at the parent.

**Resolving every target to a literal path and matching against declared patterns leaves one
genuine dead end on a live screen. It lands on GoRouter's error page.**

**CORRECTED 2026-08-29 — both original NAV rows cited the wrong file:line and both are withdrawn
as written.** The corrected finding is NAV-01a. Verification below is `grep` over the working tree
at branch `Canary`, not a re-read of the earlier scan.

| # | Call site | Navigates to | Why it fails |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NAV-01a** | `lib/features/notifications/presentation/screens/notifications_screen_v2.dart:518` | `context.push('/games/${activity.subjectId}')` → **`/games/<uuid>`** | **No route matches `/games/:id`** — the detail route is `/sports/games/:gameId` (`app_router.dart:829`); `grep -n "path: '/games"` over the router returns nothing. This is the **only** remaining `/games/` literal in `lib/`. The screen is **live and routed** (it is the notifications screen the bottom nav reaches), so tapping an activity notification is a hard stop. Correct target is `RoutePaths.gameDetail(activity.subjectId)` |
| ~~NAV-01~~ (withdrawn) | `social_search_screen.dart:1811` | — | **Not a defect.** That line reads `onTap: () => context.push(RoutePaths.gameDetail(game.id))`, which resolves to `/sports/games/<id>` and matches. The recorded `'${RoutePaths.games}/${game.id}'` form is not present anywhere in the file |
| ~~NAV-02~~ (withdrawn) | `onboarding_sports_screen.dart:194` | — | **Wrong on two counts.** (1) `:194` reads `onPressed: () => context.go(RoutePaths.createUserInfo)` — a declared route (`app_router.dart:186`); `onboardingBasicInfo` appears **nowhere in `lib/` outside `route_constants.dart:45,168`** (`git log -S` shows it left this file at `2523def`, long before this audit). It is an unused constant, not a dead-end tap — it belongs in the unused-constants count, not here. (2) Even if it had failed, **it is not launch-critical**: `onboardingSports` → `onboardingPreferences` → `onboardingPrivacy` → `onboardingCompletion` is a **closed four-screen cluster whose only inbound edges are from inside itself**. The sole navigator to `RoutePaths.onboardingSports` is `onboarding_preferences_screen.dart:171,298` — a screen in the same cluster. The live onboarding chain runs `intent_selection` → `interests_selection` → `onboardingPrimarySport` and never enters it. Independently confirmed by `flutter-feature-agent-5` and `task-auditor-11` |

**NAV-01a is not a crash — GoRouter renders its error page** (`error` route is declared) — but it
is a hard stop on a deliberate user action, and it sits on a screen every user reaches.

**Method note, for the next run.** Both withdrawn rows came from matching *constant names* and then
attributing the hit to a `file:line` from a separate pass. Resolve the literal **and re-read the
cited line in the same pass**; a `file:line` that was never re-read is not evidence. This is the
same class of error as the 14 false positives above, and it produced findings in the opposite
direction — inventing defects rather than missing them.

### Route constants, reconciled

| | Declared | Unused |
|---|---:|---:|
| `RoutePaths` | 94 | **26** |
| `RouteNames` | 110 | **58** |

Both figures supersede the run-1 "54 of 133". `RouteNames` being 53% unused reflects that the
app navigates almost entirely by **path** — 12 `pushNamed` call sites against 174 path-based
ones, and **zero** `goNamed`.

### What the bottom nav actually offers

The shell declares **four** `StatefulShellBranch`es (`app_router.dart:765, 779, 793, 807`):

| Branch | Index | Path | Renders |
|---|--:|---|---|
| home | 0 | `RoutePaths.home` | `HomeScreen` (`:768`) |
| community | 1 | `RoutePaths.community` | `RealFriendsScreen` (`:782`) |
| venues | 2 | `/sports/venues` | (venues tab, `:796`) |
| games | 3 | `/sports/games` | `GamesScreen` (`:810`) |

**The bar renders three of them.** `main_navigation_screen.dart` builds **Feeds** (`:588`),
**Venues** (`:595`), **Games** (`:643`) and a **Create** button (`_kItemCreate = 4`, `:613`).

**Two gaps worth naming:**

- **The `community` branch has no bottom-nav item.** `_onItemTapped` case 1 calls
  `_goBranch(NavigationBranch.community)` (`:232`) and the source comment says *"desktop
  side-nav only"* — but no item in the bar carries index 1. **`RealFriendsScreen` is a shell
  branch the bottom bar cannot reach.**
- **A Meetups item was removed and its handler left behind.** `_kItemMeetups = 5` (`:225`) has
  a live `case` (`:239`) showing a `nav_meetups_coming_soon` snackbar, but nothing renders it —
  `:649` is the comment *"put the `_kItemMeetups` text item here to bring it back."* Dead
  branch, not a user-visible defect.

The **Create** sheet offers create-post and create-game (`:1023-1024`); **create-meetup is
commented out** at `:1026`.

## 15b. HOP-BY-HOP TRACES — the remaining flows, 2026-08-29 (admin rows corrected 2026-08-30)

*Added for KAN-42. §15's table gave all 23 flows a verdict; five had full hop traces. These are
the other eighteen, plus the admin/moderation flows split out into rows 19-21, same format: **entry route → screen → repository/provider → RPC or table**,
`file:line` at each hop.*

**Where a flow has no persistence hop, that is the finding, not a gap in the trace.** Three of
these flows terminate in a placeholder, and the trace says so rather than inventing a hop.

| 20 | Admin — safety overview (read) | `/admin/safety-overview` `route_constants.dart:145` → `app_router.dart:1691`, screen mounted `:1710` | `safety_overview_screen.dart:25` watches `safetyOverviewProvider` (`:12-15`), service call at `:14` | `moderation_service.dart:858` `fetchSafetyOverview()` | `.from(SupabaseConfig.vSafetyOverviewTable).select()` `moderation_service.dart:862-866` → view `v_safety_overview` (`supabase_config.dart:222`) | **WORKS** — same gate |
| 21 | Moderation — resolve / act (write) | same route as flow 19 | `moderation_queue_screen.dart:293` → `_resolveReport` `:416` (service call `:423`) · `_takeAction` `:504` (service call `:511`) | `moderation_service.dart:727` `adminResolveReport()` · `:768` `adminTakeAction()` | RPC `admin_resolve_report` `moderation_service.dart:738-739` · RPC `admin_take_action` `:782-783` | **WORKS** |

**The admin/moderation authorization gate (flows 19-21).** Authorization is applied twice on the
**client**, and both times by asking the server: the route redirect calls
`rpc(SupabaseConfig.isAdminFn)` — i.e. `is_admin` — at `app_router.dart:1673` (queue) and
`:1699` (safety overview), redirecting non-admins to `/home`; the screen then repeats the check
through `isAdminProvider` (`moderation_queue_screen.dart:24`), which
`moderation_queue_screen.dart:44` and `safety_overview_screen.dart:24` branch on. That is the
correct pattern for the UI and it is **not** the finding.

**What sits behind it is now gated too — SEC-03/SEC-04 are closed, and this is the trace that
shows it.** Re-measured against `wtncuzcskpigqpmnxwws` on **2026-08-30**, read-only:

```sql
select table_name, grantee, privilege_type from information_schema.role_table_grants
 where table_schema='public' and table_name in ('v_mod_queue_open','v_safety_overview')
   and grantee in ('anon','authenticated');
select relname, pg_get_viewdef(oid, true) from pg_class
 where relnamespace='public'::regnamespace and relname in ('v_mod_queue_open','v_safety_overview');
```

- **`anon` holds no SELECT on either view** (only the inert `REFERENCES`/`TRIGGER` grants) — the
  KAN-56 revoke, still in place.
- **`authenticated` does hold SELECT — and it does not matter, because the gate is inside the
  view.** Both bodies carry `is_admin(auth.uid())` as a `WHERE` predicate
  (`v_mod_queue_open` … `AND is_admin(auth.uid())`; `v_safety_overview` … `WHERE
  is_admin(auth.uid())`). A logged-in non-admin calling PostgREST directly gets **zero rows**,
  not a leak.

So flows 19-21 are defended in depth and the depth is real: two client checks that decide what
the UI renders, and an independent server-side predicate that decides what the database returns.
**Neither client check is load-bearing for security.** The writes in flow 21 are gated the same
way — `admin_resolve_report` and `admin_take_action` authorize server-side — so bypassing the
client buys nothing anywhere in this flow.

**One flow in §15's table is traced by its absence, which is the honest result:**

- **Circles** — `grep` across `lib/features/social/**` finds no circle-specific persistence hop
  distinct from the shared feed providers above. The composer offers Circles
  (`post_composer_providers.dart:514`) and no screen consumes it. **NOT REACHABLE**, consistent
  with §15.

**One correction to §15 that falls out of tracing flow 13:** `RealFriendsScreen` is a live
shell branch with a working three-table read path, and it is **unreachable from the bottom
navigation bar** (§14e). §15 recorded it as WORKS. Both are true and the pairing is the finding
— a complete feature with no door.

---

## 16. Findings — the promise gap

Measured over **import-reachable files only**. The same patterns in dead files are excluded
because they cannot affect a user.

| Pattern | Live | Dead |
|---|---:|---:|
| `UnimplementedError` | 30 | 21 |
| `TODO`/`FIXME` | 25 | 1 |
| "coming soon" in user-visible text | 12 | 3 |
| "not implemented"/"under development" | 8 | 20 |
| Simulated / mock data | 8 | 57 |
| Empty `onPressed: () {}` | 5 | 1 |
| Empty `onTap: () {}` | 1 | 1 |

### 16a. INV-01 — CRITICAL: a live button leads to "Coming Soon"

`user_profile_screen.dart:1094` renders a **"Message"** button on the routed
`UserProfileScreen` (`lib/app/app_router.dart:1463`). It checks block status, then
`context.push('${RoutePaths.socialChat}/$userId')` (`:1475`). That route resolves to
`_PlaceholderScreen(title: 'Chat: …')` at `lib/app/app_router.dart:1617` — a construction
icon and the words "Coming Soon".

A full chat implementation exists and is not wired:
`chat_controller.dart` (741 LOC) and `chat_input_widget.dart` (695 LOC) are both
import-unreachable with zero references outside their own files.

**This is the single most visible broken promise in the app.** It is on the profile of
every other user.

### 16b. INV-02 — HIGH: a redirect target that has no route

`RoutePaths.onboardingPersonaSelection` (`lib/utils/constants/route_constants.dart:46`,
**declared twice** — also at `:169`) is used as a redirect destination at three places in
`lib/app/app_router.dart` — `:194`, `:211`, `:329`. Verified:

```
grep -n "onboarding-persona-selection" lib/app/app_router.dart   → no match
```

**No `GoRoute` registers this path.** Any redirect that resolves to it falls through to
`errorBuilder` (`lib/app/app_router.dart:146`) and the user lands on the error page. The
live trigger is the DB resume path: `onboarding_controller.dart:154-155` ("Unknown state —
restart from persona selection") → `app_router.dart:329`, evaluated on every authenticated
app load whose onboarding step is `checking`.

Dormant for a clean first-time signup. Not dormant for a user whose profile row does not
match the three recognised completion shapes.

### 16c. INV-03 — HIGH: onboarding can complete with its dependent rows missing

`rpc_onboard_profile` sets `profiles.onboard = true` atomically
(`auth_service.dart:1052-1063`). The persona-table insert and the `sport_profiles` insert
are **separate, non-transactional calls whose failures are swallowed**:
`auth_service.dart:1081-1082`, `:1090-1091`, `:1099-1100` are all empty `catch (_) {}`.

Result: `onboard = true` with no `player`/`organiser`/`hoster` row and no sport profile. The
router treats that user as fully onboarded and admits them to the app. There is no
reconciliation or repair path. This is also the most likely producer of the INV-02 crash.

### 16d. INV-04 — HIGH: two settings screens report success without saving anything

**Avatar upload at `/profile/photo`** —
`lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/settings/profile_avatar_screen.dart:624-660`:

```dart
await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate upload
...
const SnackBar(content: Text('Avatar uploaded successfully!'), backgroundColor: Colors.green)
```

No storage call, no repository call, nothing persisted. Routed at
`lib/app/app_router.dart:1063-1070`. A *real* avatar upload exists on a different route,
`/profile/edit` (`profile_edit_screen.dart:914-922` → `image_upload_service.dart:122-211`).
Two entry points for the same action; one lies.

**Availability preferences** —
`lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/preferences/availability_preferences_screen.dart:1045-1059`:
`_saveSettings()` is a `SnackBar('Availability settings saved!')` and nothing else. The file
contains no `.from()`, no `.rpc()`, no repository call. Routed at
`lib/app/app_router.dart:1311`. Mitigating: the settings menu entry that pointed at it is
commented out (`settings_screen.dart:88`), so it is currently URL-only.

**Circle visibility.** `PostComposerScreen` offers "Circle — shared with a specific circle"
in its visibility picker (`post_composer_screen.dart:1105-1140`) but contains no circle
picker; `grep -n "circleId" post_composer_screen.dart` returns nothing. Selecting it and
submitting always fails validation at `post_composer_providers.dart:514`: *"Select a circle
to post to."* The real picker (`CirclePickerSheet` → `CircleManagementSheet`, 740 LOC) is
wired only into the dead `create_post_screen.dart`. **Circles has no live entry point at
all** while the composer advertises it.

### 16e. INV-05 — MEDIUM: `/transactions` shows fabricated money

`lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/transactions_screen.dart:51` — `_transactions` is a
hardcoded list: `'Football Game Payment'`, `'amount': 150.00`, `'currency': 'AED'`, comment
*"Mock transaction data - Replace with real data from repository"*. The screen is routed at
`lib/app/app_router.dart:1165`, gated on `FeatureFlags.enablePayments`, which is **`true`**
(`feature_flags.dart:132`). Two of its buttons are `onPressed: () {}` (`:1021`, `:1032`).

No in-app link points at `/transactions` — but it is a live route on a web app, and it
displays invented financial records.

Same class of finding: `SocialOnboardingFriendsScreen` is routed
(`lib/app/app_router.dart:1487`) and shows fabricated friend suggestions — "John Smith",
avatars fetched from the external placeholder service `i.pravatar.cc` — plus a faked
contacts-permission request (`social_onboarding_friends_screen.dart:31,77`).

### 16f. INV-06 — MEDIUM: linked stub screens in Settings

`settings_screen.dart:294` is a live info-circle button that pushes `/help/center` →
`HelpCenterScreen` → **"This screen is under development"**
(`lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/help_center_screen.dart:32`).

`ContactSupportScreen` (`/help/contact`, routed at `lib/app/app_router.dart:1332`) offers
three list rows whose entire handler is a SnackBar: *"FAQ section coming soon"* (`:388`),
*"Live chat coming soon"* (`:414`), *"Phone call functionality coming soon"* (`:441`).

`RewardsScreen` (`lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/rewards_screen.dart:22`) is
`Text('Rewards Screen - Under Construction')`.

Venue share: `venue_detail_screen.dart:922` → `_snack('Sharing coming soon')`.

### 16g. INV-07 — MEDIUM: the dead game-creation wizard designed three shipped-nothing capabilities

The 7-step wizard under `lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/` is confirmed unreachable —
only `create_game_screen.dart:6-10` imports the five steps, and nothing imports
`create_game_screen.dart`. What it was built to do that the live composer cannot:

- **Payments** — payment split host-pays / split-evenly / custom, per-player AED cost
  (`participation_payment_step.dart:396-414`, `:91-208`, `_calculateCostPerPlayer:420-432`).
  The live composer has no cost field at all.
- **Venue slot booking** — a dedicated search/filter venue-slot UI
  (`venue_slot_step.dart:16-51`).
- **Player invitations** — invite from contacts / recent teammates / search with a custom
  message (`player_invitation_step.dart:20-33`) — itself backed by `_loadMockData()` (`:34`,
  `:44`), so it was never functional either.

`rebook_flow.dart:26-27` is a stub reading "This screen is under development".

### 16h. INV-08 — LOW: search is a client-side filter, not a search

`ExploreScreen` (class in `sports_screen.dart:378`, routed at `lib/app/app_router.dart:899`)
has a search field at `sports_screen.dart:1555-1599` that substring-filters the already
fetched in-memory list (`:1046-1059`). There is no server-side search RPC or full-text
query. A user searching for a sport or venue outside the loaded page gets no results.

## 17. Corrections to the record

Four established facts were wrong and are corrected here.

| Was recorded | Actually | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Live composer at `lib/features/games/.../game_composer_screen.dart` | It is at **`lib/features/misc/`** — the `games/` path does not exist | `find lib -name game_composer_screen.dart` |
| `get_nearby_posts` LIVE via `feed_repository_impl.dart` | **Dead.** `feedRepositoryProvider` / `nearbyRpcFeedProvider` are referenced only inside `feed_providers.dart` itself. The live feed is `TabFeedNotifier` → `post_repository_impl.dart:449-507`, a direct bounding-box query on `posts`, no RPC | `grep -rn "nearbyRpcFeedProvider\|feedRepositoryProvider" lib` |
| rewards: "only check-in (~985 LOC) live" | **Nothing in rewards is live.** `FeatureFlags.enableRewards = false` (`feature_flags.dart:57`) gates both the route (`app_router.dart:932`) and the check-in modal trigger (`main_navigation_screen.dart:81,96`). The implementation is complete and switched off | `grep -n enableRewards` |
| 54 of 133 route constants unused | **65 of 195.** `RoutePaths` 99 declared / 21 unused; `RouteNames` 96 declared / 44 unused | census script §13 |

## 18. Looks bad but is actually fine

Mandatory section. Each of these trips a scanner and is not a finding.

- **`route: ''` on two Settings items** (`settings_screen.dart:107,114`, Language and App
  Country). Reads as a navigation to nowhere. `_navigateToSetting` (`:1062-1070`)
  special-cases both by title and opens a picker sheet. Correct behaviour.
- **Help Center / Contact Support / Availability removed from the Settings list**
  (`settings_screen.dart:88,127,134,141` are commented out). The team already hid the stubs.
  Only the stray info button at `:294` still reaches one.
- **Rewards hidden cleanly.** No nav destination references `RoutePaths.rewards` and no
  routed screen mentions rewards. The flag hides an unfinished feature properly — this is
  the pattern the other stubs should follow.
- **`notifications_screen_v2.dart` / `activities_screen_v2.dart`** are the live routed
  screens, not abandoned rewrites. Unchanged from run 1.
- **Tab routes appearing "router-only"** — entered via `goBranch(index)`, not by path.
- **`_ErrorView` / `_EmptyView` counted as orphan classes** — private per-file helpers, 18
  of the 25 non-routed classes. Not screens.
- **`onPressed: null`** on a disabled button is a valid Flutter idiom for the disabled
  state, not a dead handler.
- **`UnimplementedError` in `settings_repository_impl.dart`** (25 sites) — the class doc at
  `:14-15` declares them deliberate. The notification/theme/accessibility methods are not
  called by any reachable UI; those screens use `notificationSettingsControllerProvider`
  instead. Only the privacy methods are wired, and those are implemented.
- **18 of the 44 `UnimplementedError` sites from run 1** live in
  `lib/features/profile/data/providers/profile_providers.dart` and the two stub repos it
  instantiates — that file is imported by nothing. Dead, not broken.

## 19. Handoff

| Finding | Owner | First action |
|---|---|---|
| INV-01 chat button → Coming Soon | Flutter feature agent | Hide the Message button behind a flag, or wire `chat_controller.dart`. Hiding is one line |
| INV-02 missing `onboardingPersonaSelection` route | Flutter feature agent | Register the route or change the three redirect targets. Also de-duplicate the constant declared at `route_constants.dart:46` and `:169` |
| INV-03 non-transactional onboarding | `cto` decides, then Supabase agent | Either fold persona + sport insert into `rpc_onboard_profile`, or stop swallowing the catches |
| INV-04 fake-success saves | Flutter feature agent | Delete `/profile/photo` (a real one exists at `/profile/edit`); make availability write or remove the route. Remove the Circle option from the composer until a picker exists |
| INV-05 fabricated transactions + fake friends | `cpo` decides, then Flutter agent | Flip `enablePayments` off or delete the route; same for `SocialOnboardingFriendsScreen` |
| INV-06 linked stub screens | Flutter feature agent | Remove `settings_screen.dart:294`; hide `/help/contact` rows |
| INV-07 dead wizard (4,972 LOC) | `cpo` | Payments, venue-slot booking and invitations are unbuilt product, not just dead code. Decide before deleting |
| INV-08 client-side search | `cto` | Decide whether server-side search is in launch scope |
| 69,612 LOC unreachable | `cpo` + `cto` | Supersedes the run-1 deletion list. Needs a decision, not a campaign |

## 20. Changelog

| Date | Run | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-27 | 2 (application inventory) | **Full map of the shipped surface at `5f92904`.** 267 non-generated files / **69,612 LOC** not import-reachable from `main.dart` — ~11× the run-1 orphan-screen figure. 101 screen classes: 74 route-referenced, 2 push-only, 7 orphaned public, 18 private helpers. **19 of 23 user flows complete end to end.** Four do not: chat is advertised by a live button and lands on "Coming Soon" (INV-01), Circles has no entry point while the composer offers it, rewards is complete but flagged off, the 7-step game wizard is dead. Two settings screens report success without writing (INV-04). `/transactions` shows fabricated AED amounts on a live route (INV-05). One redirect target has no registered route (INV-02). Onboarding can set `onboard = true` with dependent rows missing (INV-03). **Four record corrections:** composer lives in `misc/` not `games/`; `get_nearby_posts` is dead not live; nothing in rewards is live; route constants are 65/195 unused not 54/133. |

| 2026-08-28 | 3 (repo hygiene) | **Root and tree hygiene inventory at `1b83967`, §21.** 749 files / ~6.6 MB proposed for removal, **73 of them tracked** — 51 are `macos/`+`windows/`+`linux/` (no build, no CI job, no store target references them; `pubspec.yaml:168-171` states the position itself). Root holds 7 tracked regenerable artifacts (1,053,654 B, of which one 553 KB analyzer dump and one 432 KB PDF). Of the 5 root docs: `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REVIEW.md` DELETE (superseded, and its "maintainability High" verdict is now known false); `APPLE_REVIEW_SIGNIN.md`, `task_20_flutter_overhaul.md`, `flutter_localization_checklist.md` MOVE (all still operationally live); `ONBOARDING_AUDIT.md` folded in then delete. **Two findings folded in:** HYG-01 two dead onboarding services, 320 LOC, zero importers; HYG-02 `OnboardingData` declared twice incompatibly. **Two false positives caught:** `packages/` is a load-bearing `dependency_overrides` path dep, and the 5 `post_comments_*_fkey` strings resolve correctly (constraint names survived the table rename — verified against the live DB). |

| 2026-08-30 | 3b (correction) | **§15b admin/moderation trace corrected (KAN-42 rework 2).** The previous entry claimed "no `.rpc(` call site exists anywhere under `lib/features/admin/**`" and then cited one in the same sentence, and it never named the hop that actually reads the data. Replaced with three traced flows (19-21): queue read → `moderation_service.dart:818` → `v_mod_queue_open` `:822-825`; safety overview → `:858` → `v_safety_overview` `:862-866`; resolve/act writes → RPCs `admin_resolve_report` `:738` and `admin_take_action` `:782`. **Second correction found while verifying:** the `is_admin` gate is applied at the *route* as well as the screen (`app_router.dart:1673`, `:1699`), which the doc did not record. **Third, and the one that matters:** re-measuring the DB to state SEC-03/SEC-04 accurately showed both are **RESOLVED** — `anon` SELECT is revoked *and* both view bodies now carry `is_admin(auth.uid())`, so even `authenticated` non-admins get 0 rows. The findings table still carried them as live CRITICAL/HIGH four days after KAN-56 closed them; both rows are now tagged RESOLVED, §11's recommendation 2 carries its outcome, and §20b's `moderation` PARTIAL rationale ("screen gated, data not") is marked void. **Citation fix:** `moderation_queue_screen.dart:22` was two lines off in three places (§2, SEC-03 row, §11); the `rpc` call is at `:24`. `app_router.dart:1656,1682` in the false-positives section was also wrong; the RPC is at `:1673`/`:1699`. |

| 2026-09-01 | 4 (launch-readiness refresh, KAN-39) | **Re-measured at working tree `fd4df5a` for the KAN-39 promotion question; full section at §22.** **The finding that outranks the rest: the sprint-2 batch is on disk and not in git** — `git diff HEAD --stat -- lib` → **109 files, 594 insertions, 30,762 deletions, uncommitted**; `lib/` holds 833 `.dart` files at `HEAD` and 781 in the tree, rewards 36 → 4. `Canary` is separately **32 commits ahead of `main`**. **Five run-1 findings verified RESOLVED:** the notification leak (both views now `security_invoker=on`; as role `anon` both return **0 rows**, was 609 across 49 recipients), the moderation views, the rewards dead-code mass (in the tree only), the dead-code-only test suite (**103 tests pass**, was 66, and they now cover the live path), and INV-05 `/transactions` (`enablePayments=false` **committed**, route redirect-guarded at `app_router.dart:1134-1139`). INV-01 chat button gated at `user_profile_screen.dart:1104`; `AnalyticsService` wired (`f69c1f5`). **Ten findings still open (L-01…L-10):** `public.profiles` still returns **154 of 154 rows with raw `auth.users` UUIDs to `anon`** (KAN-106 authored, **not applied to production**); **558 `anon` write grants**; **49 of 71 views still definer** (advisor findings down 49 → 15); 30 `rls_enabled_no_policy`; `v_space_slots_today` **errors** on a missing `venue_opening_hours` table — wider than KAN-104 as written; **CI red on all 4 recent runs**; Arabic switcher still "Coming Soon" (`app_router.dart:603`); `STATUS.md` has **no entry after 2026-08-29** despite ~30 closures. **One `cpo` blocker retired by ruling not code:** B2 data export is descoped by `DECISIONS.md` `P-025`. **Three measurement traps recorded in §22d**, chief among them that a `security_definer=true` reloptions query returns 0 because definer is the Postgres default — the correct measure is `71 − 22 invoker = 49`. |

### SEC-15 — `anon` holds WRITE grants on all five leaking views (NEW, 2026-08-28)

**B1 is not a confidentiality defect alone.** Measured against `wtncuzcskpigqpmnxwws`,
2026-08-28, read-only:

```sql
select table_name, grantee, privilege_type from information_schema.role_table_grants
 where table_schema='public' and table_name in ('v_notifications_feed','v_notifications_ranked',
 'v_mod_queue_open','v_safety_overview','v_circle_feed') and grantee in ('anon','authenticated');

select table_name, is_updatable, is_insertable_into from information_schema.views
 where table_schema='public' and table_name in (...same five...);
```

| View | `anon` grants | auto-updatable | SECURITY DEFINER | rows to `anon` |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|---:|
| `v_notifications_feed` | SELECT INSERT UPDATE DELETE TRUNCATE REFERENCES TRIGGER | **YES** | yes | 609 (with ranked) |
| `v_notifications_ranked` | same full set | **YES** | yes | — |
| `v_mod_queue_open` | same full set | NO | yes | 9 |
| `v_safety_overview` | same full set | NO | yes | 1 |
| `v_circle_feed` | same full set | NO | yes | 6 |

**The composition.** The two auto-updatable views are the same two that bypass RLS on read
(base table returns 0 to `anon`; view returns 609). Postgres routes writes through an
auto-updatable view to the base table; SECURITY DEFINER executes as owner. **Every
precondition for unauthenticated INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE of other users' notifications is
present and measured.**

**Not demonstrated:** the write itself. Executing it is a data change and decision 019
forbids it, diagnostic intent included. Claim scope: *preconditions verified, exploitation
not demonstrated.*

**Consequence for the fix.** B1 has two independent halves — the `anon` grants and the
definer/uid-predicate question. Closing only the read path leaves `anon` holding DELETE.
The revocation is the smaller, more certain half and is verifiable by re-running query A.
It also crosses the ownership boundary: `CONTRACT.md:119` lets notifications-specialist
author only the two notification views; the other three are UNOWNED.

**Not established:** whether the full-privilege grant is project-wide default drift rather
than five bad views. Not measured across all 71 views. Cheap to measure on request.

Owner of the fix decision: `cto`. Application: PO only (decision 019).


### SEC-15a — DEMONSTRATED, and it is schema-wide drift (2026-08-28)

`cto` closed the demonstration gap without breaking decision 019: **`EXPLAIN` without
`ANALYZE` plans and performs ACL checks but executes nothing.** It is a read. The claim
moves from *preconditions verified* to **demonstrated**:

```
SET LOCAL ROLE anon;  EXPLAIN DELETE FROM public.v_notifications_feed WHERE id='…'::uuid;
  Delete on notifications -> Index Scan using notifications_pkey
       Index Cond: (id = …)                                        <-- NO RLS FILTER

SET LOCAL ROLE anon;  EXPLAIN DELETE FROM public.notifications  WHERE id='…'::uuid;   -- CONTROL
  Delete on notifications -> Index Scan using notifications_pkey
       Index Cond: (id = …)
       Filter: (current_setting('request.jwt.claim.sub')::uuid = to_user_id)   <-- RLS APPLIED
```

Identical plans; through the view the RLS filter is simply absent.

**There is no residual protection, and I verified the mechanism independently.** Query:
`pg_class` reloptions for `security_invoker` joined to `pg_roles` on the view owner.

| View | Owner | `rolbypassrls` | `rolsuper` |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|
| `v_notifications_feed`, `v_notifications_ranked`, `v_posts_time_preview`, `v_user_reputation`, `v_my_drafts`, `v_hidden_list`, `v_needs_organiser` | `postgres` | **true** | false |
| `geometry_columns` | **`supabase_admin`** | **true** | **true** |

With `security_invoker=false` the base-table access is checked as the **owner**, and every
owner here bypasses RLS outright. **RLS is not "maybe insufficient" — it is definitionally
not consulted.**

**Population — this is drift, not five bad views.** Reproduced independently, same figures:

| Measure | Count |
|---|---:|
| Views in `public` | 71 |
| Granting `anon` INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE | **70** |
| Of those, SECURITY DEFINER | 49 |
| **Definer + auto-updatable = LIVE WRITE PATHS** | **8** |

The 8: `v_notifications_feed`, `v_notifications_ranked`, `v_posts_time_preview`,
`v_user_reputation`, `v_my_drafts`, `v_hidden_list`, `v_needs_organiser`, `geometry_columns`.
**It reaches posts, reputation and drafts — not only notifications — destructively.**

**Why the REVOKE is safe (verified, and stronger than first claimed).**
`grep -rnE "\.from\('v_|\.from\(\"v_" lib --include='*.dart'` → **0**. The app never
writes through a view. Going further: **none of the 8 is referenced anywhere in `lib/` at
all** — not read, not written (`grep -rl` per view → 0 for all 8). So revoking `anon`
entirely on these 8 has **zero** client-behavioural effect, not merely zero write effect.

**`geometry_columns` needs a different remediation path** and must not be batched blindly
with the other 7: it is owned by `supabase_admin`, a **superuser**, and is PostGIS-managed
rather than ours. Whether we may alter its grants at all is a question for the fix author.

**Correction inherited from `cto`, carried here because it changes a do-not-re-flag note:**
`geometry_columns`/`geography_columns` were recorded as confirmed false positives. **That
ruling was correct for READ and wrong for WRITE** — `geometry_columns` is one of the 8, and
`anon` DELETE against PostGIS metadata is not harmless. **A false-positive ruling is scoped
to the privilege it was made about.** Any SEC-06 do-not-re-flag note needs that qualifier or
the one that matters gets skipped.

**Fix order (cto ruling, T-012/T-001/T-011):** the **REVOKE comes first**, ahead of all
`security_invoker` work — it closes a destructive path; the invoker work closes a
confidentiality one. Two uid predicates would leave `anon` holding DELETE on eight views.
Authorship: one project-wide privilege migration, `cto`'s, PO-gated. It is not a
notifications/moderation/social change, so it does not need the ownership matrix widened.

**`geometry_columns` CANNOT be revoked — verified, T-015.** Not "may fail". Migrations run
as `postgres`; `postgres` is **not** superuser and is **not** a member of the owner:

```sql
select current_user,                                          -- postgres
  (select rolsuper from pg_roles where rolname=current_user),  -- FALSE
  pg_get_userbyid(relowner) for geometry_columns,              -- supabase_admin
  pg_has_role(current_user,'supabase_admin','USAGE');          -- FALSE
```

`REVOKE ... ON geometry_columns FROM anon` fails for insufficient privilege.

**The trap is sharper than an error.** `REVOKE ... ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM anon`
— the obvious single-statement form — either halts partway through a security migration or
**skips the object it cannot touch while reporting success**. The second outcome is a fix
that reports total and is not.

**T-015 ruling:** the migration **enumerates its targets explicitly** and excludes
`geometry_columns` by name, with a comment. **7 of 8 write paths close**; the 8th is
documented as platform-owned with the ownership query above as evidence. If the PostGIS
grant is judged to matter, it is a Supabase support question — not something we force.

**Still not done by any agent:** the write itself, and application to production.
Decision 019 stands.


### The five zero-policy orphan tables — answered for `cto` (2026-08-28)

`cto` asked whether anything reads them, to decide "policy or drop". Measured via `prosrc`
(not `pg_depend` — it does not track plpgsql bodies), `pg_views.definition`, and `grep` over `lib/`.

| Table | rows | fn refs | definer fns | view refs | policies | `lib/` refs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `challenge_types` | 8 | **0** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| `surface_catalog` | 30 | **0** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| `context_rating_config` | 2 | 1 (`_get_context_config`) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `safety_blocklist_terms` | 2 | 1 (`content_hits_blocklist`) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `space_slot_holds` | **0** | 1 (`_slot_conflicts_hold`) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 (const + model) |

**All five are RLS-on / zero-policies, and all three referencing functions are INVOKER
(`prosecdef=false`).** So they are **not** a definer funnel — the pattern `cto` ruled on for
`games`/`squad_members` does not apply here. An invoker function reading an RLS-on
zero-policy table returns **0 rows to every real caller**. Verified:

```sql
set local role authenticated;
select count(*) from safety_blocklist_terms;  -- 0   (2 rows exist)
select count(*) from context_rating_config;   -- 0   (2 rows exist)
select count(*) from challenge_types;         -- 0   (8 rows exist)
select count(*) from surface_catalog;         -- 0   (30 rows exist)
```

**`challenge_types` and `surface_catalog` have no reader at all** — no function, no view, no
client. 38 rows of config nothing can reach.

**RULED — `cto`, 2026-08-28: REVOKE NOW, DEFER THE DROP. T-007 does not transfer here.**
Dead Dart is recoverable from git in one command; **38 rows of dropped config are
recoverable from nothing.** A table with no reader costs nothing to leave in place, so the
asymmetry between "wrong to drop" and "wrong to keep" is enormous and one-sided. Revoking
removes the exposure and is free; the drop is the irreversible half and carries no urgency.

**`space_slot_holds` — KEPT, `cpo` ruling `P-013`.** It is parked scaffolding for venue slot
booking, and **booking is committed scope** (Phase 1B, Month 9, `P-002` from `11 v2` F.3 and
`13a` Appendix C). Same ruling as `lib/features/payments/`: **deferred product is not dead
code.** Do not drop it in the orphan-table sweep.

**Note on `challenge_types`:** `challenges` sits under the competitive-leagues fork, which
`P-002` ruled **in scope**. These two tables are config for a surface that was never built,
not the feature itself — dropping them does not touch that ruling.

### BUG-07 — the safety blocklist fails open, twice, independently (NEW, 2026-08-28)

`content_hits_blocklist(p_text, p_locale default 'any')` is **STABLE, INVOKER**, and reads
`safety_blocklist_terms`. Two defects, either of which alone returns "clean" for all input:

**1. The locale predicate can never match.** The function filters
`where locale = 'any' or locale = p_locale`. Both stored terms are `locale = 'en'`. The
client (`moderation_service.dart:546`) defaults `locale = 'any'` and passes it straight
through. With `p_locale='any'`, an `'en'` term matches neither branch. Demonstrated as
**service role**, which bypasses RLS entirely:

```sql
select content_hits_blocklist('buy a fake passport here');  -- 0
-- while safety_blocklist_terms contains ('fake passport','en',is_regex=false)
```

The predicate treats `'any'` as a property of the stored term, but the caller passes it as
the *query* locale. A term is reachable only when the caller names its exact locale.

**2. RLS returns zero rows to every real caller.** The function is INVOKER over an RLS-on,
zero-policy table, so as `authenticated` it reads 0 terms regardless of locale. Fixing the
locale bug alone would not make the blocklist work.

**Severity — and the reason this is not a live hole today.** `contentHitsBlocklist` has
**no caller anywhere in `lib/`** (`grep -rn "contentHitsBlocklist" lib` → only its own
definition). Nothing invokes it, so nothing is currently being let through. `moderation_service.dart`
itself *is* live — imported by `game_composer_screen.dart`, `profile_screen.dart`,
`report_dialog.dart`, and both admin screens — so the method is one wiring change away from use.

**It is a trap, not a breach.** Whoever wires up the blocklist gets `0` — a plausible,
silent "clean" — for every input, and both defects are invisible at the call site.

**RULED — T-016 (`cto`, 2026-08-28). Fix, do not delete — stated as an explicit exception to
T-007's deletion default**, because Dabbler carries user-generated content and a content
blocklist is a control it should have. The right end state is a working check, not the
honest absence of one. **Fix both defects or remove both artifacts — never one of each.**

- **Locale:** `where p_locale = 'any' or locale = 'any' or locale = p_locale`.
- **RLS:** make `content_hits_blocklist` **SECURITY DEFINER** and **REVOKE** direct `SELECT`
  on `safety_blocklist_terms` from `anon` and `authenticated`. **NOT a read policy.**

**Why not a policy — the reasoning is specific to what the table is.** A read policy for
`authenticated` would work, and would be wrong: every user could then download the list of
banned terms and author around it. **A moderation control whose contents are visible to the
people it constrains is not a control.** Same treatment for `context_rating_config` via
`_get_context_config`.

**Verification is part of the decision, not an acceptance criterion someone may trim:**
**verify as role `authenticated`, never as service role.** A service-role test passes while
production fails — that is exactly how this survived.

**Not a promotion blocker** (`cpo` `P-013` concurring). Recorded in `BRIEF.md` as a known
trap because moderation is a corpus commitment; the App Store requirement is the
report/block mechanism, which exists and is live.


## 20b. SLICE VERDICTS — the 25 slices re-judged against the 2026-08-29 evidence

*Added for KAN-44. §3's feature table classified the 25 slices on 2026-08-26 from LOC, screen
count and routing. This section re-judges them against evidence that did not exist then — the
full class census (§14d), the navigation graph (§14e) and the eighteen new flow traces (§15b).
**It supersedes §3 where they disagree, and the disagreements are listed.***

| Verdict | Count | Slices |
|---|---:|---|
| **SHIPPED** — routed, reachable, persists | 12 | `social`, `auth_onboarding`, `profile`, `games`, `explore`, `venues`, `news`, `home`, `location`, `venue_submissions`, `settings`, `search` (**restored 2026-08-29** — its only PARTIAL evidence, NAV-01, is withdrawn) |
| **PARTIAL** — reachable, incomplete at some hop | 6 | `moderation` (**re-judged 2026-08-30: the SEC-03 rationale is void** — data is gated server-side; PARTIAL now rests only on report-triage UX depth) · `admin` (**correction:** it does have a persistence path — §15b flows 19-21) · `notifications` (**new 2026-08-29** — feed and push work, but the activity row's game tap is a dead end, NAV-01a) · `comments` (works, `v_comments` only just secured) · `onboarding` (INV-03 swallowed failures) · `community`/friends (**works but no bottom-nav door** — new) |
| **SCAFFOLD** — built, flag-gated off | 1 | `rewards` — 14 RPCs live and unreachable (§15b flow 17) |
| **DEAD** — no reachable entry | 6 | `chat` (placeholder, §15b flow 18) · `circles` (no consumer) · `payments` · the 7-step game wizard · `analytics` (DEAD-22) · `data_export` (DEAD-21) |

**Three verdicts moved since §3, each on new evidence:**

| Slice | §3 (2026-08-26) | Now | Why it moved |
|---|---|---|---|
| `community` / friends | SHIPPED | **PARTIAL** | The read path works across three tables (§15b flow 13) but **the bottom nav renders no item for shell branch 1** (§14e). A complete feature with no door |
| ~~`search`~~ | SHIPPED | **SHIPPED — move reverted 2026-08-29** | The move rested entirely on NAV-01, now withdrawn: `social_search_screen.dart:1811` reads `context.push(RoutePaths.gameDetail(game.id))` and resolves correctly. Nothing else was against it |
| `notifications` | SHIPPED | **PARTIAL** | `notifications_screen_v2.dart:518` pushes `/games/<id>`, which matches no route (**NAV-01a**). The slice's own feed, read state and push delivery all work; one outbound tap does not |
| `explore` | SHIPPED | SHIPPED | Held — the census found no orphan in its routed set; `SportsHistoryScreen` is an ORPHAN *class* in a live file, which is DEAD-15, not a slice verdict |

**What the new evidence did *not* change.** Nine of the twelve SHIPPED slices were re-checked
against the census and the graph and every one held. **The audit's original slice verdicts were
mostly right, and saying so is part of the report** — the value of this pass is the three that
moved and the dead end, not a wholesale re-rating.

**Correction 2026-08-29.** Two of the three moves above did not survive re-verification: `search`
returns to SHIPPED and `notifications` takes its place at PARTIAL. **The count is unchanged at
12/6/1/6 — one slice swapped for another, which is why the totals row still reconciles.** The
`community`/friends move stands.

### On `INDEX.md` — the KAN-44 acceptance criterion cites a path that does not exist

The AC says *"`INDEX.md` updated so every new headline number is answerable in one lookup."*
`task-auditor` correctly reported that **`docs/INDEX.md` does not exist**. The artefact does
exist, at **`.claude/agent-memory/master-analyst/INDEX.md`** — 500+ lines, the answer desk,
updated in the same pass as this section.

**I have not created `docs/INDEX.md`, and the omission is deliberate.** A second index would be
a second authority for the same facts, and this document's own rule — one owner per fact,
everything else links — is what stopped the 233-colour and 49-view figures from propagating
further than they did. **The citation is wrong about the path, not about the artefact.** If the
PO wants the index under `docs/`, it should *move*, not be copied.

---

## 21. Repo hygiene inventory — 2026-08-28

**Scope:** every non-directory file in the project root, the four unused platform
folders, and stray files elsewhere in the tree. **Read-only:** nothing here was
moved or deleted. `version-control` executes once the PO approves.

**The bar for DELETE:** nothing references it AND nothing builds from it AND it is
either regenerable or preserved in `git log`. Every verdict below carries the
command that produced it.

### 21a. Reference-count method

Inbound references were counted with, for each candidate `F`:

```
grep -rIl --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=build --exclude-dir=node_modules \
     --exclude-dir=.dart_tool -F "F" . | grep -v "^\./F$" | wc -l
```

This matches the filename anywhere in any text file — deliberately over-broad, so a
zero is strong evidence. Two results needed disambiguation because the basename is
common (`README.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`); those were re-checked by path.

### 21b. Project root — every non-directory file

| path | size | tracked? | inbound refs | verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pubspec.yaml` | 8,002 B | yes | build input | **KEEP** | Flutter manifest |
| `pubspec.lock` | 59,543 B | yes | build input | **KEEP** | resolved deps |
| `analysis_options.yaml` | 1,816 B | yes | `flutter analyze` | **KEEP** | lint config |
| `l10n.yaml` | 120 B | yes | `flutter gen-l10n` | **KEEP** | points at `lib/l10n/` |
| `firebase.json` | 901 B | yes | Firebase tooling | **KEEP** | |
| `devtools_options.yaml` | 184 B | yes | 0 | **KEEP** | Flutter-tool generated; regenerated on every DevTools launch. Zero refs is normal for it — not evidence of rot |
| `package.json` / `package-lock.json` | 651 / 6,933 B | yes | 13 / 3 | **KEEP** | referenced by `.claude/helpers/security-scanner.sh` and several skills |
| `skills-lock.json` | 3,552 B | yes | 3 | **KEEP** | `docs/status/version-control.md`, agent memory |
| `.gitignore` | 4,342 B | yes | — | **KEEP** | |
| `.env.example` | 803 B | yes | `run.sh:24`, `build_ios.sh:19` | **KEEP** | both scripts print it in their error path |
| `run.sh` | 979 B | yes | executable entry point | **KEEP** | the only correct way to `flutter run` |
| `build_ios.sh` | 1,903 B | yes | executable entry point | **KEEP** | store build; calls `scripts/gen_dart_defines.sh` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | 9,947 B | yes | governance | **KEEP** | |
| `.mcp.json` | 597 B | **no** (gitignored) | — | **KEEP** | holds live tokens; correctly untracked |
| `.env` | 813 B | **no** (gitignored) | `run.sh`, `build_ios.sh` | **KEEP** | real secrets; correctly untracked |
| `.flutter-plugins-dependencies` | 23,190 B | no | tool-generated | **KEEP** | regenerated by `flutter pub get` |
| `.an_out.txt` | 553,010 B | **yes** | 0 | **DELETE** | captured `flutter analyze` output, last committed `8a8178f` 2026-04-25. Regenerable in one command; preserved in `git log` |
| `flutter_analyze.txt` | 56,629 B | **yes** | 0 | **DELETE** | same — a second, older capture of the same command |
| `.dto_candidates` | 3,908 B | **yes** | 0 | **DELETE** | one-off refactor scratch output, 2026-02-28 |
| `.dto_moves_map` | 7,116 B | **yes** | 0 | **DELETE** | same batch |
| `.dto_conflicts` | 0 B | **yes** | 0 | **DELETE** | empty file, same batch |
| `.dupes_candidates` | 0 B | **yes** | 0 | **DELETE** | empty file, same batch |
| `.05B_summary.json` | 1,141 B | **yes** | 0 | **DELETE** | same batch |
| `1ab7a966-…_DABBLER_CONTENT_ENGINE.pdf` | 431,850 B | **yes** | 0 | **ASK** | a marketing/content PDF with a UUID filename. Not regenerable and not in `docs/`. **Ask the PO** whether the source of record lives in Notion; if so, delete — if not, it should move to `docs/` with a real name |
| `flutter_01.log` … `flutter_04.log` | 21,625 B total | **no** | 0 | **DELETE** | run logs 2025-11-17 → 2026-07-12. Already matched by `.gitignore:20` (`*.log`) — they were never tracked |
| `flutter_run.log` | 518 B | **no** | 0 | **DELETE** | same |
| `test_icon.dart` | 93 B | **no** | 1 (its own name inside `flutter_analyze.txt`) | **DELETE** | 93-byte scratch file at root; the only "reference" is a line in a file also being deleted. Violates `CLAUDE.md`'s no-tests-at-root rule |
| `upload_certificate.pem` | 1,294 B | **no** (untracked) | 0 | **ASK** | appeared 2026-08-27. This is the Play Store **upload key certificate** — the public half, so not a secret, but it is a signing artifact and belongs with the Android release material, not at root. **Ask the PO** whether to move it under `android/` or delete it as a re-downloadable Play Console export. **Do not commit it** in either case |
| `.DS_Store` | 18,436 B | no | 0 | **DELETE** | macOS Finder metadata. 19 exist across the tree (157,772 B total), none tracked |

### 21c. The five root documents

Read in full before judging. Verdicts differ per document — this is not one decision.

| path | age | verdict | reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `APPLE_REVIEW_SIGNIN.md` | `c70b2e8` 2026-06-26 | **MOVE → `docs/APPLE_REVIEW_SIGNIN.md`** | **Still true and operationally live.** It is the App Review demo-account instruction sheet, used at every store submission. Zero inbound references is expected — its reader is a human filling in App Store Connect, not a build. Do not delete. Note it ships with a `<ENTER_DEMO_PASSWORD_HERE>` placeholder, which is the correct posture (the password is not in the repo) |
| `task_20_flutter_overhaul.md` | `32452e1` 2026-05-05 | **MOVE → `docs/briefs/task_20_flutter_overhaul.md`** | **Still relevant — the work it describes is not finished.** It specifies the `post_comments`→`comments` / `post_likes`→`likes` / `public_activities` migration. 6 references to the old table names remain in `lib` (see 21f). Deleting it would delete the only written statement of the target architecture for that migration |
| `flutter_localization_checklist.md` | `2f8e3ba` 2026-05-12 | **MOVE → `docs/`** | Generic Arabic/English l10n audit checklist. `l10n.yaml`, `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` and `app_ar.arb` all exist, so the work is partly done and the checklist is a live gap-tracker. Nothing in `docs/` covers l10n |
| `ONBOARDING_AUDIT.md` | `de8f3f1` 2026-04-25 | **FOLD IN → then DELETE** | Largely superseded — `PROJECT_STATE.md` §14–16 covers onboarding reachability with newer numbers, and its Bug 1 (missing `onboardingPersonaSelection` route) is already recorded as INV-02. **But it held two facts this document did not**, both re-verified today and now folded into 21f below. Delete only after 21f is accepted |
| `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REVIEW.md` | `474248a` 2026-03-17 | **DELETE** | **Stale and superseded, and its judgements are now known to be wrong.** It rates Maintainability "High" and Separation of Concerns "Good" — against a codebase that run 2 measured as 69,612 LOC unreachable with three competing error conventions. It predates every audit in this document by five months. Keeping it risks someone citing it. `git log` preserves it |

### 21d. Unused platform folders

`macos/` (29 tracked, 674 files, 4.9 MB), `windows/` (15 tracked, 88 KB),
`linux/` (7 tracked, 48 KB). **Verdict: DELETE — but see the risk note.**

Independently confirmed:

- **No build targets them.** `scripts/cloudflare-build.sh:27` runs `flutter build web`;
  `build_ios.sh:44` runs `flutter build ipa`; the only CI workflow,
  `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml:36`, runs `flutter build web`. No desktop target
  anywhere.
- **`pubspec.yaml` says so itself.** `pubspec.yaml:168-171` pins `win32: 5.15.0` with the
  comment *"win32 code paths only run on Windows desktop builds, which we do not ship."*
  That is the PO's own recorded position, not an inference.
- **No plugin requires a desktop registrar to exist.** `macos/Flutter/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.swift`
  and the `linux`/`windows` equivalents are generated by `flutter pub get` from
  `.flutter-plugins-dependencies`; they are consumed only by a desktop build. This is an
  app, not a plugin — `pubspec.yaml` has no `flutter.plugin.platforms` block.
- **The `Platform.is*` checks are unaffected — verified, not assumed.** The three sites are
  `bug_report_screen.dart:452-454` (`isWindows`/`isMacOS`/`isLinux`), inside a `String`
  getter that labels a bug report. These are `dart:io` **runtime** checks. `dart:io`
  compiles on every non-web target regardless of which platform folders exist; the
  constants resolve at runtime, not against a folder. Removing `macos/` cannot break them.
  They become permanently-false branches, which is what they already are.

**RESOLVED 2026-08-28 by `DECISIONS.md` G-004 — `macos/` goes.** The PO overrode `T-012`'s
"macOS stays" conclusion: macOS is not a targeted platform for Dabbler. The recommendation
below to confirm `macos/` with the PO was the right call and has now been answered; the
answer is delete. `windows/` and `linux/` were never in question.

**Risk note (not hygiene), and it is the thing the PO accepted rather than missed:** deleting these makes `flutter build macos|windows|linux` fail
until `flutter create --platforms=macos .` regenerates them. That is a one-command
recovery and no shipping target is affected. But if the PO intends a macOS desktop build
in the next 12 months, keeping 5 MB is cheaper than re-deriving the Xcode project settings.
**Recommend deleting `windows/` and `linux/` unconditionally (136 KB, 22 tracked files —
no plausible future) and confirming `macos/` with the PO before removing it.**

### 21e. Rot elsewhere in the tree

| path | size | tracked? | inbound refs | verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/create_game_screen.dart.broken` | 632 LOC | yes | 0 | **DELETE** | `grep -rIn 'create_game_screen' --include='*.dart' lib` → no match. Not compiled (`.broken` is not `.dart`). Already flagged in §1 finding 8 |
| `lib/design_system/JSONS/` | 40 KB, 10 files | yes | 0 | **DELETE** | already ADR'd: `docs/DECISIONS.md:143` entry 008, status ACTIVE, "confirmed dead 2026-08-26". **Do not confuse with `lib/design_system/tokens/`**, which is a declared Flutter asset at `pubspec.yaml:223` and is load-bearing |
| `lib/core/services/onboarding_service.dart` | 199 LOC | yes | 0 | **DELETE** | `grep -rIn "onboarding_service.dart" lib test integration_test` → no importers. See 21f |
| `lib/core/services/mock_onboarding_service.dart` | 121 LOC | yes | 0 | **DELETE** | same command, no importers. Mock for the above |
| `scripts/analyze_appbutton.sh` | 1,448 B | yes | 0 | **ASK** | one-off analysis script, 2026-02-28. Harmless; delete only if the PO agrees it is spent |
| `scripts/migrate_to_material3.sh` | 4,412 B | yes | 0 | **ASK** | one-off codemod for a migration that `lib/core/design_system/MATERIAL3_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` says is done. Same call |
| `scripts/generate_token_json.py` | 2,138 B | yes | 0 | **ASK** | regenerates design-token JSON. Zero refs, but it is the *producer* of a live asset directory (`lib/design_system/tokens/`). **Keeping is the safe default** — deleting it means the tokens can only be hand-edited |
| `scripts/parse_logs.py` | 1,236 B | yes | 0 | **ASK** | log parser for the `flutter_*.log` files being deleted. Probably spent |
| `scripts/cloudflare-build.sh`, `gen_dart_defines.sh`, `run_integration_tests.sh` | — | yes | 6 / 5 / 3 | **KEEP** | **CORRECTED 2026-08-28.** The first two are live build/release entry points. **`run_integration_tests.sh` is not — it is invoked by nothing**, only by hand per its own usage comment (`:12-13`). Verified: zero references in any workflow, script or config. Keep it, but it is a manual tool, not a gate |
| `lib/design_system/*.md` (4 files: `COLOR_TOKEN_MAPPING`, `style_guide`, `SPORTS_COLOR_MAPPING`, `ONBOARDING_STYLE_GUIDE`) | — | yes | 0 each | **ASK** | design-system documentation sitting inside `lib/`, referenced by nothing. Candidates to move to `docs/`, but they are **design intent**, not analysis — the PO or `cto` should say whether they are still the design of record before they move or go |
| `lib/core/design_system/*.md` (7 files) | — | yes | mixed | **KEEP where referenced** | `MATERIAL3_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` is cited from live code at `lib/core/design_system/colors/app_colors.dart:10,17` (inside a `@Deprecated` message a developer will read) and `design_system.dart:6`. `README.md` and `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` are cross-linked from it. **Only `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `LAYOUT_STRUCTURE.md` and `ICONSAX_USAGE_GUIDE.md` have zero inbound refs — ASK before touching those** |
| `App screenshot/` | 13 MB, 7 tracked | yes | 0 | **ASK** | store screenshots. 13 MB on disk but only 7 files tracked, so most of it is untracked local clutter. Ask whether the tracked 7 are the current App Store set |
| `docs/agents/` | empty | — | — | **DELETE** (directory) | empty directory; the agent definitions live in `.claude/agents/` and their status files in `docs/status/` |
| `.github/prompts/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/__pycache__/` | 3 `.pyc` | check | 0 | **DELETE** | compiled Python bytecode, never a source artifact |
| 19 × `.DS_Store` | 157,772 B | none tracked | 0 | **DELETE** | and add `.DS_Store` to `.gitignore` if absent |

### 21f. Folded in from `ONBOARDING_AUDIT.md` — two findings this document did not hold

Both re-verified today against the current tree, not transcribed.

- **HYG-01 · Two dead onboarding services, 320 LOC, zero importers.**
  `lib/core/services/onboarding_service.dart` (199 LOC) is a SharedPreferences-based
  onboarding tracker fully replaced by the DB-authoritative `OnboardingController`.
  `lib/core/services/mock_onboarding_service.dart` (121 LOC) is its test mock.
  `grep -rIn "onboarding_service.dart\|mock_onboarding_service.dart" lib test integration_test --include='*.dart'`
  returns **nothing**. The 2026-04-25 audit said `set_password_screen.dart` was the last
  consumer; that link is now gone too. **Unblocked for deletion.**
  (`onboarding_gamification.dart`, 419 LOC, is *not* in this group — it still has two
  importers, both inside the dead `onboarding_scenarios/profile/` slice, so it dies with
  that slice and not before.)

- **HYG-02 · `OnboardingData` is declared twice, incompatibly.**
  `lib/features/auth_onboarding/domain/models/onboarding_state.dart:40` declares a Freezed
  `OnboardingData`; `lib/features/auth_onboarding/presentation/providers/onboarding_data_provider.dart:5`
  declares a second, hand-written class of the same name, consumed by
  `OnboardingDataNotifier` at `:126`. Same name, different type, same feature slice. Not
  currently throwing, but it is a live import-ambiguity trap for anyone editing onboarding.
  **Owner: `cto` decides which survives.**

### 21g. Looks bad but is actually fine

- **`packages/flutter_web_auth_2/` and `packages/sign_in_with_apple/` (72 tracked files)
  are NOT vendored cruft — they are load-bearing.** `pubspec.yaml:167-180` declares them as
  `dependency_overrides` with `path:` entries. Deleting them breaks `flutter pub get` and
  therefore every build. The comment at `:172-176` explains why they exist (a patched
  Gradle line). **Do not touch.**
- **The 5 `post_comments_author_profile_id_fkey` strings in `lib` are not broken queries.**
  They look like references to a table renamed in the `task_20` migration. They are
  PostgREST **FK-constraint hints**, and Postgres preserves constraint names across
  `ALTER TABLE … RENAME`. Verified live:
  `select conname, conrelid::regclass from pg_constraint where conname like 'post_comments%'`
  → 6 constraints, all now on table `comments`. The hints resolve correctly.
  Sites: `post_providers.dart:214`, `news_repository_impl.dart:44,90`,
  `post_repository_impl.dart:1351,1401`. **Leave them.** (Renaming the constraints later
  would break the app — worth an ADR.)
- **`devtools_options.yaml` has zero inbound references and is still not deletable.** It is
  read by the Flutter DevTools tooling by filename convention, not by any file in the repo.
  A naive reference scan flags it; it is fine.
- **`lib/design_system/tokens/` looks like a duplicate of `JSONS/` and is not.** `tokens/`
  is a declared Flutter asset (`pubspec.yaml:223`) shipped into the bundle. `JSONS/` is
  the dead one. Getting this backwards would break theming at runtime.
- **`.mcp.json` and `.env` sitting untracked in the root is correct, not sloppy.** Both
  hold live credentials and are gitignored by design.
- **`.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` publishes to `gh-pages`, not Cloudflare** — it is a
  second, parallel deploy path that fires on `main` and `BETA`. Out of hygiene scope, but
  worth knowing it exists: it is not the release topology `CLAUDE.md` describes.

### 21h. Totals

| bucket | files | bytes | tracked |
|---|---|---|---|
| Root — regenerable artifacts, DELETE | 7 | 1,053,654 | **7** |
| Root — untracked logs + scratch, DELETE | 6 | 22,236 | 0 |
| Root docs — MOVE to `docs/` | 3 | 19,680 | 3 |
| Root docs — DELETE (superseded) | 2 | 17,349 | 2 |
| Root — ASK | 2 | 433,144 | 1 |
| Platform folders `macos/` `windows/` `linux/` | 702 on disk | 5,259,264 | **51** |
| Dead code in `lib/` (`.broken`, `JSONS/`, 2 services) | 13 | ~65,000 | 13 |
| `.DS_Store` across tree | 19 | 157,772 | 0 |
| **Total proposed for removal (DELETE verdicts only)** | **749** | **≈6.6 MB** | **73** |

**Read that as two numbers, not one.** The number that matters for repo weight is
**73 tracked files, ~6.5 MB**, of which 51 files / 5 MB is the three platform folders. The
root junk is 7 tracked files but the single most-visible offence — a 553 KB analyzer dump
and a 432 KB PDF sitting next to `pubspec.yaml`.

**Nothing in the DELETE column changes a build, a CI job, or a store submission.** The one
item with any build consequence is `macos/`, flagged in 21d and downgraded to a PO
confirmation.

### 21i. Handoff

| Item | Owner | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Execute 21b/21c/21e DELETE + MOVE verdicts | `version-control` | One commit per bucket: `chore: remove regenerable analysis artifacts` · `docs: move root documentation into docs/` · `chore: remove unused desktop platform folders`. Do not batch them |
| `.DS_Store` and `__pycache__` | `version-control` | Delete, and confirm both patterns are in `.gitignore` |
| HYG-01 delete 2 dead onboarding services (320 LOC) | Flutter feature agent | Zero importers verified — safe alone, no coordination needed |
| HYG-02 duplicate `OnboardingData` | `cto` | Decide which declaration survives, then a feature agent executes |
| ~~`macos/` keep-or-delete~~ | **RESOLVED** | **`DECISIONS.md` G-004, 2026-08-28 — the PO overrode `T-012`'s "macOS stays" ruling. macOS is not a targeted platform, so the uncommitted `macos/**` deletion proceeds to a normal commit rather than being reverted.** Verified: `macos/` is absent from disk and the deletion is staged. **The consequence my §21d note stated still holds and was accepted, not overlooked:** `flutter build macos` fails until `flutter create --platforms=macos .` regenerates the folder — one command, no data lost. Nothing else in `T-012` is affected |
| The 7 ASK items (PDF, `.pem`, 4 scripts, `App screenshot/`, design-system `.md`s) | **PO** | Listed in 21b/21e — none guessed at |

## 22. Launch-readiness refresh — run 4, 2026-09-01 (KAN-39)

*Written for the KAN-39 launch-readiness assessment. This section supersedes §1, §13 and §16
where they disagree. Every number below was re-measured today against working tree
`fd4df5a` and Supabase project `wtncuzcskpigqpmnxwws` (read-only). Where a run-1/run-2/run-3
figure has moved, the delta is shown rather than the figure restated.*

### 22a. The finding that outranks everything else in this section

**The sprint-2 batch is on disk and not in git. 109 files in `lib/` are changed and
uncommitted — 594 insertions, 30,762 deletions.**

```
$ git diff HEAD --stat -- lib | tail -1
109 files changed, 594 insertions(+), 30762 deletions(-)
$ git status --porcelain lib | cut -c1-2 | sort | uniq -c
  56  D      (unstaged deletions)
  46  M      (unstaged modifications)
   7 D       (staged deletions)
```

Measured both ways, the gap is unambiguous:

| Measure | At `HEAD` (`fd4df5a`) | In working tree | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `.dart` files under `lib/` | 833 | 781 | **−52** |
| `.dart` files under `lib/features/rewards/` | 36 | 4 | **−32** |
| Non-generated `lib/` LOC | — | 203,580 | — |

**What this means for the promotion question.** Every measurement in this section taken from
the working tree — the rewards collapse from 20,545 LOC to 691, the deletion batch, the
onboarding-flow rewrite across `auth_service.dart` (−108 lines net) and `app_router.dart`
(−90) — describes **a build that has never been committed, never been pushed to `Canary`,
never been built by Cloudflare, and never been exercised by CI.** `canary.dabbler.pro` is
not running this code. Neither is `app.dabbler.pro`.

`Canary` is **32 commits ahead of `main`** (`git rev-list --count origin/main..origin/Canary`).
So there are two separate undeployed layers, not one: 109 uncommitted files above `Canary`,
and 32 commits on `Canary` above production.

**This is also a data-loss exposure, not only a process gap.** 30,762 deleted lines
represented by unstaged working-tree deletions are recoverable from git; the 594 inserted
lines and the 46 modified files are not recoverable from anywhere if the tree is reset.
Owner: `version-control`. This should be committed before anything else in this section is
acted on.

### 22b. What genuinely closed since run 3 — verified, not reported

Each row was re-measured today. "Verified" means the measurement was taken in this run, not
that a ticket says Done.

| Run-1/2/3 finding | Status now | Evidence taken 2026-09-01 |
|---|---|---|
| **§1.1 — `v_notifications_feed` / `v_notifications_ranked` leak 609 rows / 49 recipients to `anon`** | **RESOLVED** | Both views now carry `security_invoker=on` (`pg_class.reloptions`). As role `anon`: `select count(*)` → **0 rows on both**. The `anon` SELECT grant still exists but RLS on `notifications` now applies to the caller, which is the correct fix. |
| **§1.2 — `v_mod_queue_open` / `v_safety_overview` open to `anon`** | **RESOLVED** (already logged 2026-08-30) | `anon` holds only `REFERENCES, TRIGGER` on both — SELECT is revoked. |
| **§1.3 — rewards is 20,545 LOC of unreachable code** | **RESOLVED in the working tree, NOT in git** | 36 files at `HEAD` → 4 in the tree; 691 LOC remaining ≈ the live check-in path `cpo` `P-002` ruled was committed scope. See 22a. |
| **§1.6 — every test covers dead code; zero tests touch the live path** | **RESOLVED** | `flutter test` → **103 tests, all pass** (was 66). Coverage now includes `test/data/repositories/profiles_repository_impl_test.dart`, which is on the live path. |
| **INV-05 — `/transactions` serves fabricated AED amounts on a live route** | **RESOLVED (route unreachable)** | `FeatureFlags.enablePayments = false` at `feature_flags.dart:146` **and committed at `HEAD`**. `app_router.dart:1134-1139` redirects `/transactions` → `RoutePaths.home` when the flag is false. The mock data at `transactions_screen.dart:51` is still in the file; nothing can reach it. |
| **INV-01 — a live "Message" button on every profile lands on "Coming Soon"** | **RESOLVED** | `FeatureFlags.messaging = false` (`feature_flags.dart:56`, committed at `HEAD`); the button is gated at `user_profile_screen.dart:1104` with the flag. |
| **`AnalyticsService` is 18 empty method bodies** (`cpo` blocker B5) | **PARTIAL — downgraded from RESOLVED 2026-09-01** | The **sink** is wired: `lib/core/services/analytics/analytics_service.dart`, 244 LOC, `rpc_track_event` (commit `f69c1f5`, KAN-51; file moved from `lib/core/services/`). **`cpo` corrected my read and is right:** their `P-008` finding was about the **emission layer**, not the sink — one live emission site (`main.dart:78`, a flags snapshot), nothing on the games-confirmed path. **A wired sink does not make "games confirmed" computable.** What settles it is one real `game_created`/`game_confirmed` row observable in `analytics_events` — **a measurement neither seat has taken.** NOT ESTABLISHED. |
| **Analyzer/test baseline** | **IMPROVED** | `flutter analyze --no-pub` → **0 errors, 37 warnings, 93 issues total** (run 1: 0 errors, 55 warnings, 157 total). |

### 22c. What is still open, measured today

| # | Finding | Severity | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L-01** | **The sprint-2 batch is uncommitted** — see 22a | **BLOCKER** | `git diff HEAD --stat -- lib` |
| **L-02** | **`public.profiles` returns all 154 rows, each with a raw `auth.users` UUID, to `anon`** | **HIGH — open in production** | As role `anon`: `select count(*) filter (where user_id is not null), count(*) from public.profiles` → **154 / 154**. This is KAN-106, sitting **In Review** — the fix is authored, it is **not applied to production**. |
| **L-03** | **`anon` holds INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on `public.profiles`** and on the wider table set | **MEDIUM (defence-in-depth)** | `information_schema.role_table_grants` → `profiles` grants to `anon`: `DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, TRIGGER, TRUNCATE, UPDATE`. **558 anon write grants** across `public`. RLS is the only thing standing between this and a write. KAN-86, open. |
| **L-04** | **49 of 71 views are still SECURITY DEFINER** | **MEDIUM** | 71 views; **22** carry `security_invoker=true`; the remaining **49** are definer-by-default (no reloption). The advisor reports **15** `security_definer_view` findings — down from 49, so the exposed subset has shrunk substantially, but the population has not. KAN-26, open. |
| **L-05** | **30 tables have RLS enabled and zero policies** | **MEDIUM** | Supabase security advisor: `rls_enabled_no_policy` × 30. Unchanged from run 1. KAN-26. |
| **L-06** | **`v_space_slots_today` is broken in production, not merely mis-granted** | **MEDIUM** | Querying it errors: `relation "public.venue_opening_hours" does not exist`, raised from `find_slots(uuid,date,integer)` line 22. The underlying table is gone; the function was never updated. KAN-104, In Review — the ticket scopes the grant and the `is_booked` bug and does **not** name this missing table. |
| **L-07** | **CI has still never passed** | **HIGH (process)** | `gh run list --workflow=CI` → the four most recent runs on `Canary` (2026-08-29 21:49, 2026-08-30 07:43, 09:59, 10:29) are all `failure`. The sibling "Anon reachability allowlist" workflow passes on all four. So `main`'s analyze/test gate gates nothing, while the security allowlist gate does work. KAN-112, open. |
| **L-08** | **`DataExportService` still has zero importers** | **NOT A DEFECT — descoped** | `grep -rln data_export_service lib/` excluding the file itself → **no hits**. This is correct and intended per `DECISIONS.md` `P-025` (2026-08-30, PO): the export *entry point* stays, the *mechanism* is not built for MVP 1 / MVP 1+. KAN-52 and KAN-103 are `descoped`. **`cpo`'s blocker B2 is retired by PO ruling, not by code.** |
| ~~**L-09**~~ | ~~Arabic locale switching is still "Coming Soon"~~ | **WITHDRAWN 2026-09-01 — FALSE POSITIVE** | **Retracted the same day it was filed, after `cpo` caught it.** Language switching works. See 22d. |
| **L-10** | **`docs/STATUS.md` has no entry after 2026-08-29** | **MEDIUM (governance)** | Newest entry: `## 2026-08-29 — KAN-41 / KAN-88`. The ~30 tickets closed on 2026-08-31 and 2026-09-01 produced **zero** entries in the file `STATUS.md` itself designates as "the channel the PO reads". By its own Rule 2 those completion claims are invalid. This is a real gap in the record, and it is why this section had to re-measure rather than read. |

### 22d. Looks bad but is actually fine

**WITHDRAWN — L-09, the Arabic switcher. I filed this as open and it is a false positive.**
`app_router.dart:599` declares `/language_selection`, a placeholder rendering
`Text('Language Selection - Coming Soon')`. **Nothing navigates to it** — `grep -rn
"language_selection\|languageSelection" lib/` returns exactly two hits, its own route
declaration and an unused import at `app_router.dart:68`. It is an orphan.

The **live** path is a different route: `/settings/language` at `app_router.dart:1262` renders
the real `LanguageSelectionScreen` (226 LOC). And the actual in-app switcher does not use that
route at all — `settings_screen.dart:1062` `_navigateToSetting()` intercepts the Language item
and calls `_showLanguagePicker()` at `:1073`, a modal bottom sheet reading and writing
`ref.read(localeProvider)` at `:1090`. **Language switching works.**

`cpo` caught this and notes it is the *second* time this exact line has been filed as a blocker
— raised and retracted on 2026-08-27, recorded in `INDEX.md` §11b as WIRE-10. **Filing it a
third time is now the specific thing to check for.** The lesson generalises: a "Coming Soon"
string on a declared route proves nothing until you grep for who navigates to it. Two routes
can serve the same concept, one orphaned and one live, and the orphan is the one that greps
first.

**Also corrected: `enablePayments`.** `cpo`'s section reports it `true` at `feature_flags.dart:139`,
carried from their 2026-08-26/27 snapshot. Measured today it is **`false`** — at `:146` in the
working tree and `:142` at `HEAD`. `P-023`/`P-020`'s "payments out entirely" is satisfied.

**Partially corrected: fabricated social content.** `cpo`'s hardcoded *"127 active in 5 km"*
is **gone** — no match in the file today. But the fabricated recent-search list survives:
`social_search_screen.dart:630-636` hardcodes `_recent` = `'#football'`, `'@ahmed_fc'`,
`'padel courts dubai'`, `'sunday meetup'`, `'#nbaplayoffs'`, rendered at `:688` on a route
reachable at `app_router.dart:1385`. The trending rows are **real** — `:1709` reads
`h.postCount`. So the honesty defect is narrower than filed but not closed.

*Mandatory section. Omitting it means the audit was shallow.*

- **`transactions_screen.dart` still contains hardcoded AED mock data at `:51`.** A grep
  makes this look like INV-05 unfixed. It is not: the route is redirect-guarded on a flag
  that is `false` and committed. Deleting the screen is optional cleanup, not a fix.
- **`anon` still holds SELECT on `v_notifications_feed` and `v_notifications_ranked`.** A
  grants query alone reads as the original CRITICAL still being open. It is not — the views
  are `security_invoker=on`, so the grant is harmless and the empirical read as `anon`
  returns 0. **Check the reloption and the row count, never the grant alone.** This is the
  exact trap that made run 1 understate the surface.
- **`definer_opt_views` counts to 0 in `pg_class.reloptions`.** SECURITY DEFINER is the
  *default* for a Postgres view and stores no reloption, so a naive query for
  `security_definer=true` returns zero and looks like a clean bill of health. The correct
  measure is `total_views − security_invoker views` = 71 − 22 = **49**.
- **`anon` reading 217 rows from `v_game_card` is not a leak.** Game discovery is a public
  surface by design, and the raw-UUID half of it was fixed in `deabd43` (KAN-87). The view
  carries `auth.uid()` in its body.
- **`lib/features/rewards/` collapsing to 4 files is not an accidental deletion.** It is
  `cpo` `P-002` executed: the 3-tier check-in surface is committed launch scope, the 15-tier
  system above it was not. 691 LOC is the expected remainder.
- **103 tests passing while 30,762 lines are deleted in the tree is not a contradiction.**
  The run-1 finding was that all 66 tests covered dead code. Those tests went with the code;
  the current 103 are a different, live-path set.

### 22d-bis. Reconciliation with `cto` and `cpo` — 2026-09-01

Both seats replied after §22 was written. Recorded here because two of their corrections change
this document, and one of them corrects me.

**All three seats reach the same verdict independently: not promotable — and all three moved to
the *same new reason* once the git finding surfaced.** The binding blocker is no longer "defects
remain" but "the artifact that would be promoted does not exist in any committed form."
`cpo`'s phrasing: *closed-in-tree is not closed.*

| # | Disagreement | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`13b` P0-6 / PDPL export.** I recorded it "retired by `P-025`". | **`cpo` wins; my framing was too soft.** They rule it **waived, not satisfied — a legal-risk acceptance, not a descoping**: *the PO may waive a gate we authored; PDPL is not a gate we authored.* Mine described the ticket status, theirs the exposure. `P-025` should carry a recorded risk acceptance rather than a descope label. **PO decision.** |
| 2 | `P-025` keeps the export **entry point visible** while the mechanism does not exist. | **`cpo`'s finding, adopted.** This is the same advertised-affordance-that-does-nothing pattern removed as B4 a week ago, reinstated deliberately. **Unruled.** |
| 3 | **B5 / `AnalyticsService`.** I marked it RESOLVED on a wired sink. | **`cpo` wins.** Downgraded to **PARTIAL** in §22b above. |
| 4 | `cto` adds **KAN-58 (logout/FCM)** as a third HIGH blocker, no ledger event either way. | **Not adopted as measured.** Not in my inventory; I have not verified it. Recorded as `cto`'s open item. |
| 5 | `anon` write grants: my **558** vs `cto`'s **184**. | **Same fact, different units** — 558 grant rows (table × verb) ≈ 184 tables × 3 verbs. Not an escalation. State the unit. |

**`cto` corrected their own section against my `profiles` finding**, in terms worth preserving:
they had reported "2 views return data to `anon`" as the security posture — *"an accurate answer
about VIEWS [let] stand as the answer about EXPOSURE. The base table was never in my denominator."*
The correct statement: **the definer-view lineage is closed; the anon-readable surface is not, and
`profiles` is the larger part of it.**

**Measurement drift worth noting.** `cto` reproduced the diffstat as **604 insertions / 30,763
deletions**; I measured **594 / 30,762** roughly an hour earlier, and re-measuring returned
`cto`'s figure. **The uncommitted tree is changing while it is being assessed** — which sharpens
L-01 rather than softening it.

### 22e. Handoff

| Item | Owner | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **L-01** — commit the 109-file sprint-2 batch, push to `Canary`, verify the Cloudflare build | `version-control` | **Do this first.** Nothing else in this section is verifiable in a deployed artifact until it is done. A successful push is not a successful deploy. |
| **L-02** — apply the KAN-106 `profiles` fix to production | `cto` (only seat that may apply) | Fix is authored and In Review; production is unchanged. Re-verify as role `anon` after applying. |
| **L-06** — `v_space_slots_today` errors on a missing `venue_opening_hours` | `backend-owner` → `cto` | Scope is **wider than KAN-104 as written**. Either restore the table or rewrite `find_slots`. Add to the ticket before it clears review. |
| **L-07** — CI red on 12/12 runs | `cto` | KAN-112. Until it is green, "analyze and tests pass" is a local claim only. |
| **L-10** — STATUS.md gap | all agents; reconciliation by `master-analyst` | ~30 closures on 2026-08-31/09-01 unlogged. |
| **L-03 / L-04 / L-05** | `backend-owner` → `cto` | KAN-86, KAN-26. Defence-in-depth; not launch blockers on their own. |

## 23. Run 5 — same-day re-measure, 2026-09-01 (KAN-39 addendum)

*Written hours after §22, at HEAD `b18180f`. **§22's open findings L-01 and L-02 are both CLEARED.**
`cto` reported this and I re-verified every claim independently rather than accept it — which
surfaced a defect in my own instrument that §22 explicitly told readers to trust.*

### 23a. L-01 — the uncommitted batch. CLEARED, verified.

| Measure | §22 (hours earlier) | now |
|---|---:|---:|
| Uncommitted in `lib/` | 109 files, +604/−30,763 | **1 file, +6/−4** |
| `.dart` under `lib/` — HEAD vs tree | 833 vs 781 | **759 vs 759** |
| Commits local-only (`origin/Canary..HEAD`) | — | **0** — pushed |
| `Canary` ahead of `main` | 32 | **80** |

HEAD is `b18180f` on `Canary`. The batch is committed and pushed. **L-01 closed.**

### 23b. L-02 — `profiles` readable by `anon`. CLOSED — and my probe was wrong, not the fix.

`cto` reported `ERROR 42501: permission denied for table profiles`. My probe returned 154 rows.
I chased the divergence rather than pick a side, and **the divergence is in my instrument.**

```sql
-- anon's ACL on public.profiles
{postgres=arwdDxtm/postgres, anon=m/postgres, authenticated=arwdm/postgres, service_role=...}
--                            ^^^^^^ 'm' = MAINTAIN only. No 'r' (SELECT).
select has_table_privilege('anon','public.profiles','SELECT');  -- false
select grantee, privilege_type from information_schema.role_table_grants
 where table_name='profiles' and grantee='anon';                -- zero rows
```

**Three independent instruments say the leak is closed:** the raw `relacl`,
`has_table_privilege`, and `cto`'s live `42501`. **One says otherwise — mine.** And it
contradicts *itself* in a single row:

```sql
begin; set local role anon;
select current_user, has_table_privilege(current_user,'public.profiles','SELECT'),
       (select count(*) from public.profiles), current_setting('is_superuser');
-- → anon | false | 154 | off
```

A row asserting simultaneously that the role cannot select and that it read 154 rows is not
evidence about the database; **it is evidence the probe is broken.** Verdict: **L-02 CLOSED.**
KAN-106 landed between §22 and now.

### 23c. RETRACTION — §22d's recommended method is not reliable. This is the important part.

**§22d told every future reader: *"Check the reloption and the empirical row count as role
`anon`, never the grant alone."* The second half of that is now withdrawn.** The
`set local role anon; select count(*)` probe returned a confident, precise, wrong number, and
I had already promoted it as the instrument that settles disputes.

**Two aggravating details.** First, the probe is **silently** wrong — it returns a plausible
count rather than erroring. Second, **it is not uniformly wrong**: in the same session it
correctly returned 0 for `v_notifications_feed` and 217 for `v_game_card`, both role-sensitive.
An instrument that is right most of the time and wrong without warning is worse than one that
fails loudly.

**Revised method for any anon-exposure question — use all three, and treat disagreement as
unresolved rather than picking the alarming reading:**

1. `has_table_privilege('anon', '<rel>', 'SELECT')` — cheap, and authoritative on grants.
2. The raw `pg_class.relacl` — shows `PUBLIC` grants that a `grantee='anon'` filter hides.
3. A **real PostgREST call with the anon API key** — the only true ground truth, because it is
   what the shipped web bundle actually does. Neither `SET ROLE` nor a grant query is that.

**And the deeper trap, which is about agreement rather than about any single tool.** Three
instruments agreed L-02 was closed and none of them was ground truth; `cto` and I then read
*opposite* answers off the *same* broken instrument and each treated the other as corroboration.
**Convergent wrong instruments look exactly like verification.** Count the *families* your
evidence comes from, not the readings — two readings from one instrument are one piece of
evidence, whichever way they point.

**SETTLED, later the same day — by the instrument named above.** `cto` ran a real PostgREST
call with the shipped anon key, with a control:

```
GET /rest/v1/profiles?select=id,user_id
  → HTTP/2 401 · {"code":"42501","message":"permission denied for table profiles"}

GET /rest/v1/v_notifications_feed?select=*        (control — was 609 rows / 49 recipients)
  → HTTP/2 200 · content-range: */0 · body []
```

**L-02 closed on ground truth, not on agreement.** The control is the more informative half:
`v_notifications_feed` returns **200 with zero rows, not a denial** — the correct end state for a
flipped invoker view. The view still resolves; RLS is what returns nothing.

**And `cto` discounted their own earlier `42501`, which is the point worth keeping.** That
reading came from `set local role` — **the same instrument that handed me 154 rows.** In their
words: *"Mine agreeing with the grant queries didn't make my instrument sound; it made it lucky.
Two readings from one broken instrument aren't independent evidence just because they disagree."*
The HTTP call is the first evidence in the whole thread from outside that family.

### 23b-i. An asymmetry the control surfaced — not a defect, worth naming

`profiles` and `v_notifications_feed` are now closed **by different mechanisms, with different
durability**:

| | mechanism | what its safety depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `public.profiles` | **grant revoked** — `401` before RLS is consulted | **nothing.** No policy can regress it open. |
| `v_notifications_feed` | **`anon` still holds SELECT**; the invoker flip means RLS returns 0 | **`notifications`' RLS staying correct.** |

This is the `T-012` shape again — protected by RLS rather than by a revoked grant. It is
**correct here**, because `KAN-56` deliberately chose the invoker flip over a revoke and the base
table carries real policies. But the two are not equally durable, and a future policy edit on
`notifications` can reopen the second where nothing can reopen the first. Worth knowing before
anyone touches those policies; not worth a ticket today.

### 23d. Also cleared since §22

- **KAN-58 (logout teardown) — SHIPPED, verified.** `auth_service.dart:348` calls
  `PushNotificationService.instance.revokeToken()` **first**, while the session is still valid
  (the ordering `T-004` required), then clears `UserService` `:354`, `ProfileCacheService`
  `:355`, `LocationService` `:356`, then `_supabase.auth.signOut()` `:363`. `revokeToken()`
  deletes from `fcm_tokens` scoped to `user_id` **and** `platform`
  (`push_notification_service_mobile.dart:292-294`, `_web.dart:146-148`) and also calls
  `FirebaseMessaging.deleteToken()`. **Broader than specified**, not narrower.
- **KAN-59 (push authorization)** — reported shipped by `cto`; **not independently verified by me.**
- **KAN-116 (emoji font subset) — REPORTED SHIPPED, AND THE SYMPTOM IS STILL ON SCREEN.**
  See §23g. Marking it unverified was the right call.

### 23e. What is actually left

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| **Cloudflare build of `b18180f`** | **CONFIRMED 2026-09-01** — `team-lead` queried the Cloudflare Pages API directly (account `4e6bcc77a0c0b7a1e05571be39eb46c9`, project `webapp`); `latest_deployment` reports `commit_hash b18180f` built **successfully** on `Canary`. Primary source, not a report of a report. **One caveat kept on the record:** the alias cited is `canary.webapp-3bw.pages.dev`, the project's default alias — **that the custom domain `canary.dabbler.pro` serves this same deployment is not part of that evidence** and is worth one check, since a custom-domain mapping is exactly the sort of thing that fails silently. |
| **CI** | Red / non-gating (KAN-112, `DECISIONS.md`). Known, not new. |
| **Web pass (unauthenticated)** | **PARTIAL.** App loads, `/auth-welcome` renders, no console errors. **KAN-116's symptom reproduced on the live deploy** — see §23g. |
| **Everything behind login** | **UNVERIFIED AND CURRENTLY UNTESTABLE.** `qa-tester` cannot authenticate through browser automation at all — a capability gap, not a pass. Home, game screen, profile, and every authenticated flow are **untested, not passing.** |
| **Native iOS / Android** | **STILL UNVERIFIED.** Per `T-026` nothing is QA-verified until `qa-tester` runs. |
| Default-privilege drift (`T-045`) | Open. The `supabase_admin` grantor rule is unalterable from our roles, so dashboard-created tables still arrive with `anon` write. Not exploitable today. |
| L-04 / L-05 / L-06 / L-07 / L-10 | Unchanged from §22c. |

**Revised position: no known defect blocks promotion.** What remains is **unverified rather
than known-broken** — a materially better position, and a much weaker basis for a hard NO.

**Updated the same day, twice.** The Cloudflare leg is confirmed and the web deploy of `b18180f`
built successfully. **But `qa-tester`'s pass was not clean, and the remaining gate is wider than
one item** — see §23g. CI is red but separately known to be non-gating, so it does not block.

### 23f. The lesson, stated plainly

**§22 reported a snapshot as a state.** Three agents shipped fixes in parallel while the
assessment was being written, and every headline blocker in it cleared within hours. `cto` made
the same error and said so. The defect is not in any one measurement — it is in **publishing a
point-in-time reading of a moving system without a re-check immediately before posting.**

**Standing rule for future audits: re-measure every BLOCKER-severity finding immediately before
publishing, and stamp each with the time it was taken, not just the date.** A finding whose
remedy is actively being worked on has a half-life measured in hours.


### 23g. `qa-tester`'s live pass — not clean. Two findings, and a pattern.

*Run against the live `Canary` deploy, `canary.dabbler.pro`, commit `b18180f`. This also
discharges the KAN-115 caveat in passing: the custom domain does serve this build.*

**Clean:** app loads, `/auth-welcome` renders, no console errors.

#### 23g-i. KAN-116 is marked Done and the symptom is still on screen

`qa-tester` reproduced the stretched-word-gap symptom on button labels **twice**, confirmed by
pixel comparison — **and** byte-parsed the actually-served font and confirmed the diagnosed root
cause (Noto Emoji's oversized space glyph) is genuinely **gone** from it. So this is not "the fix
never shipped." Filed as **KAN-117** for fresh diagnosis.

**My contribution to that diagnosis — a different family of evidence, since two byte-parses of the
font already agree with each other:**

`_withEmojiFallback` (`app_theme.dart:783-811`) attaches the bundled `'Noto Emoji'` family as a
`fontFamilyFallback` to **exactly the 15 named `TextTheme` slots** — `displayLarge` … `labelSmall`.
Nothing else. Measured:

```
$ grep -rn "TextStyle(" lib | wc -l        →  421   across 102 files
```

**421 inline `TextStyle(...)` constructions bypass `TextTheme` entirely and therefore receive no
`fontFamilyFallback` at all.** The comment at `:784-787` states the mechanism that then applies:
Flutter web's CanvasKit *"doesn't inherit the OS's native emoji font"* and falls back to a
**CDN-fetched** emoji font. That CDN font is **not** the subsetted one.

**`cto` retracted their root-cause diagnosis (2026-09-01), and the retraction needs one caution.**
Their reasoning: *"if removing the space glyph changed nothing, the space glyph was never the
cause."* **That inference is not sound as stated, and it has the same shape as the error it is
correcting.** It holds only if the removal reached the font actually doing the rendering. If the
hypothesis below is right — the affected text uses CanvasKit's CDN-fetched, unsubsetted copy, not
the bundled one — then removing the glyph from the bundled font changes nothing **whether or not**
an oversized space glyph is the cause.

**Correct status: UNRESOLVED, not disproven.** Retracting the certainty was right; retiring the
candidate is premature. Overcorrecting here has a practical cost — KAN-117 would hunt elsewhere
and could miss a fix that is really about *fallback coverage* rather than about subsetting.

**Hypothesis for KAN-117, stated as testable rather than concluded:** the bundled font is
correctly subsetted — both byte-parses are right — and the symptom persists because the affected
text never uses the bundled font. It routes through an inline `TextStyle` to CanvasKit's own
unsubsetted CDN fallback, which still carries the oversized space glyph. `qa-tester` reproduced
it on **button labels**; a button whose label is built with an inline `TextStyle` fits this
exactly. **Not verified by me** — it predicts that the symptom appears only on inline-styled text
and never on text using a `TextTheme` slot, which is the check that would confirm or kill it.

**Independent convergence, `cto`, 2026-09-01.** They ran a per-screen comparison without knowing
why it would matter, and posted it as *"a lead, not a diagnosis"*:

| screen | verdict | theme text styles | inline `const TextStyle` |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `welcome_screen.dart` | **WORKS** | 13 | **0** |
| `auth_welcome_screen.dart` | **BROKEN** | 4 | **10** |

**This is the kind of agreement that counts, because the instruments differ** — a per-screen
comparison and a global coverage count, arrived at separately, predicting the same split. Contrast
§23c, where three readings agreed and two of them came from one broken probe.

**The tension this must account for — `cto` raised it, and it is real.** CanvasKit is **web-only**,
but fact #13 says the symptom reproduces on the PO's **native Android** device. So the mechanism as
stated cannot be the whole story.

**A refinement that would resolve it — offered as hypothesis, not conclusion**, because the error
being corrected today was exactly this kind of plausible-mechanism reasoning: the mechanism is
*"uncovered text → an engine-chosen fallback font"*, and **that part is platform-independent.**
What differs is only the *identity* of the substitute — CanvasKit's CDN copy on web, the system
font-resolution chain on Android. If it holds, the symptom is predicted on **both** platforms,
matching #13 without needing two causes. **Untested.** The alternatives `cto` named stand until it
is: an analogous native fallback path, two different causes producing one symptom, or #13 needing
re-verification.

**Consequence for the discriminating test — run it on both platforms and record which.** In
`cto`'s words: *"only-inline on web and only-inline on native are different findings."*

#### 23g-ii. Nothing behind login has been tested — and currently cannot be

`qa-tester` **could not test login or any authenticated flow**: entering a password into a login
field is blocked by its own safety rules regardless of authorization, including for the project's
dedicated QA account, and the browser tab broke on password-field focus independently.

**Read this as a capability gap, not a pass.** Home, game screen, profile and every authenticated
flow are **untested**. In `qa-tester`'s own words: *don't read my silence on those flows as them
being fine.* **This is the single largest unverified surface in the project** and it is
structural — no amount of re-running the current setup closes it. Needs a route to an
authenticated session that does not involve typing a password (a seeded session token, a test
harness bypass, or a native-only pass). Filed as a follow-up.

#### 23g-iii. The pattern — third instance today of the same failure

| # | What was verified | What was true |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `set local role anon` said `profiles` leaked 154 rows | Anon-key HTTP said `401`. Probe was broken. |
| 2 | Grant queries + `cto`'s `42501` agreed L-02 was closed | Correct — but by luck; both from one instrument family. |
| 3 | **Two byte-parses agree KAN-116's font is subsetted** | **The screen still shows the bug.** |

**Every one is the same error: verifying the *mechanism* instead of the *outcome*.** The font
bytes are the mechanism; the rendered pixels are the outcome. The grant table is the mechanism;
the HTTP response is the outcome. **In each case the mechanism-level check was correct and the
conclusion drawn from it was wrong**, because the mechanism was not the only thing between the
change and the result.

**Rule, generalising §23c and §23f:** *verify at the layer the user experiences, not the layer you
changed.* A fix is proven by the symptom disappearing, never by the diff being present — and
"I verified the artifact" is a statement about the artifact, not about the bug.

**And its converse, which today also produced a wrong step:** *when a fix does not move the
symptom, first prove the fix reached the path.* "It changed nothing" is only evidence about the
cause if it was applied where the effect lives. Recorded with `cto`'s own framing in
`LEARN.md` — **a true measurement is not a demonstrated cause.** Their measurements were
byte-level, reproducible and correct, and the causal claim drawn from them was never measured:
*"Noto Emoji contains a 1.27em space and is reachable"* is true; *"therefore it is rendering the
space you see"* was not tested. **State what result would falsify a diagnosis, and get it, before
calling a cause found** — explanatory power is not evidence.

**`cto`'s corollary, worth more than the defect:** this was caught by **the first real QA pass
anyone has run** — not by code review, static analysis, or three leadership agents reconciling
measurements for two days. *"A human-equivalent looking at the live page found in one session a
defect that survived my confident root-cause AND a shipped fix."* **That is the argument for
`T-026` in one sentence, and it applies to every surface in §23e that is still unverified** —
native, CI, and everything behind login. KAN-117 should be read as evidence for why those must be
verified, not merely as a defect of its own.
