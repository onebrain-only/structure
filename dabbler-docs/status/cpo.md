# docs/status/cpo.md — cpo status log

**Owner:** `cpo` — **this agent, and only this agent, writes here.**
Every other agent reads it. master-analyst reads it to reconcile `docs/STATUS.md`;
it does not write here.

**Purpose:** The product judgement record. Every verdict on every idea, with the
document it was judged against.

---

## SCOPE

Judges ideas, features, scope changes and pivots against the 26-document business
corpus. Product **and** protect. Read-only on code and on the corpus — it judges,
it does not edit either.

## THE RULE

The status entry is **part of the decision, not offered afterwards.** It is the last
thing written before closing, and the agent may not report DONE without it. A verdict,
a refusal, or a question escalated to the PO still gets an entry — those are the ones
most likely to be skipped and most needed.

## FORMAT — newest first

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — KAN-NN — Title
**Question:** what was put to you
**Verdict:** the call, in one line
**Why:** the reasoning, with the citation
**Consequence:** what this forces elsewhere
**Escalated:** what went to the PO, or none
**Handoff:** which agent picks this up, or none
```

# LOG

## 2026-08-27 — B4 — A correction to a correction: WIRE-09 overcorrected, B4 stands
**Question:** `master-analyst` re-checked WIRE-09 and reported all seven placeholder routes
unreachable — *"Zero navigation sites"* for all six owning route constants. That would have
retired **B4**, one of my four remaining promotion blockers.

**Verdict:** **Right for five constants, wrong for `socialChat` — the one B4 rests on.
B4 stands.**

**Why:** `user_profile_screen.dart:1475` does `context.push('${RoutePaths.socialChat}/$userId')`
— one live navigation site. The Message button at `:1093` is unconditional; the screen is
routed at `app_router.dart:1463`; the route's guard at `:1607` reads
`if (!FeatureFlags.messaging) return RoutePaths.home;` and **`FeatureFlags.messaging = true`**
(`feature_flags.dart:53`), so it does not fire. The user lands on the placeholder.
`master-analyst`'s own `INDEX.md` §11b still ranks this **#1 in "Worst 5"** — the re-check
contradicts their own INV-01, and INV-01 holds.

Corrected figure: **7 placeholder routes · 6 unreachable · 1 reachable.** The six are not
uniform either — `socialChatList`, `socialEditPost` and `socialAnalytics` carry **no guard**
and are unreachable only because nothing links them, which matters on a web app where
routes are URL-reachable.

**Consequence:** `BRIEF.md` §10 B4 narrowed with the full chain cited, and the wider §16
counts now explicitly marked as `master-analyst`'s and cited rather than independently
verified. Two smaller defects logged on the same path for whoever fixes it: `_sendMessage`
wraps the push in `isBlocked.whenData(...)` so the button does nothing while that provider
loads or errors, and the placeholder title calls `conversationId.substring(0, 8)`, which
throws on ids under 8 characters.

**The lesson this adds — the reciprocal of this morning's.** A correction that **softens**
a finding earns the same check as one that hardens against it. Relief is a bias like any
other; taking WIRE-09 at face value would have dropped a real blocker on a blanket claim.
Recorded in agent memory alongside `P-006`. Also recorded: check
`.claude/agent-memory/master-analyst/INDEX.md` **§11b** — a "corrected facts, do not quote
the old version" table — before citing any figure of theirs read earlier in a session.

**Escalated:** asked `master-analyst` to add **WIRE-09** to §11b with the `socialChat`
exception spelled out, so the next reader does not retire INV-01 off the blanket claim.

**Handoff:** none. WIRE-09 and WIRE-10 both fold into the dead-route cleanup.

## 2026-08-27 — KAN-50 — CORRECTION: three code claims in the launch-readiness assessment did not hold
**Question:** `team-lead` verified the code claims in my KAN-39 assessment before relaying
them and found three wrong. Correct the record before `cto` builds on it.

**Verdict:** **The corrections are accepted in full. I re-verified all four myself.**
**B3 is retracted — the claim was false**, and it had been ranked a promotion blocker and
dispatched to `cto` as KAN-53. B5's count was wrong. B6 overstated. B2 I had understated in
my own favour. **The overall verdict — not launch-ready — is unchanged; B1 and B2 carry it.**

**Why:** all three errors were **code measurements**, taken directly, by a seat whose
evidence domain is the business corpus. The corpus half of the same document — where I
quoted documents I had read — held up completely under the same review.

- **B3 (retracted).** `settings_screen.dart:104` has a Language row; `:1064` opens
  `_showLanguagePicker()`; `:1091` reads and writes `localeProvider`, which `main.dart:254`
  watches and `:268` passes into the app. Switching works. `PROJECT_STATE.md` WIRE-10
  attributes the `app_router.dart:590` placeholder to `/settings/language`; it belongs to
  `/language_selection`, an orphaned route. **I repeated the record and then escalated a
  MED/small finding to a launch-gate P0 without opening the screen.**
- **B5 (number wrong, finding sharper).** 4 empty methods, not 18 — the static sink
  `trackEvent`/`trackScreen`/`setUser`/`reset`. The other ~14 tracking methods are fully
  written and call `trackEvent`. So the instrumentation already exists and one empty sink
  discards all of it: KAN-51 is wiring a provider, not building instrumentation.
- **B6 (restated).** Cricket is supported — 107 occurrences. Absent is the *wedge*:
  CricClubs, Playtomic, Strava all 0. Strategic conclusion unchanged.
- **B2 (understated).** 2,092 LOC, not ~1,500. Zero importers confirmed.

**Consequence:** `BRIEF.md` §10 corrected with a correction banner and a status table;
`DECISIONS.md` P-004 amended and **P-006** added (the CPO sources code facts from the
Analyst, never by measuring); `ROADMAP.md` Wave P reduced to four blockers; `LEARN.md`
gains the generalising lesson. KAN-53 retitled `[RETRACTED]`, commented and moved to In
Review for `task-auditor` to close. KAN-51 rescoped, KAN-52 line count fixed, KAN-54
retitled and restated.

**Escalated:** **`master-analyst` must correct `PROJECT_STATE.md` WIRE-10** — the route path
is wrong and it is not my file to edit.

**Handoff:** `cto` — **do not action KAN-53.** KAN-51 is smaller than first scoped. KAN-52
is larger. `task-auditor` — KAN-50 and KAN-53 are both back in In Review.

## 2026-08-27 — KAN-39 / KAN-50 — Launch-readiness: the business gap analysis
**Question:** Is the business ready for a commercial launch, and what specifically is not?
Fill `docs/BRIEF.md` from the 26-document corpus; find the contradictions, the gaps, and
the drift from measured build state.

**Verdict:** **NOT READY.** Four of `13b`'s ten binding P0 launch criteria are red against
`PROJECT_STATE.md`, plus the GTM playbook's analytics gate. Separately, the cricket-first
wedge — the entire acquisition strategy — has no cricket feature in the product. The app
being live is not in question; being *promotable* is.

**Why:** the bar is the corpus's own, not mine. `13b launch runbook`: *"The go/no-go gate
(Section C) is binding. If a P0 criterion is red, you hold the launch. No exceptions, no
'we'll fix it live.'"* Red: P0-9 security (609 notification rows across 49 recipients
readable by the `anon` key that ships in the public web bundle), P0-6 data safety (PDPL
export unreachable — `DataExportService` has zero importers), P0-10 bilingual integrity
(`/settings/language` renders `Text('Language Selection - Coming Soon')` against
`06e` §5.3's *"Not 'Arabic version coming soon.'"*), and `14` H6 no-dead-buttons (a
"Message" button on every user profile routes to "Coming Soon"). Plus `08` Part 2 §A.2's
*"Analytics instrumentation verified"* — `AnalyticsService` is 18 empty method bodies, so
"games confirmed" (`02`'s north star, `01` Truth 7's optimisation target), CSAU, every
Month-3/6/9 target and all six Path-C pivot triggers are uncomputable.

On the wedge: `07d` calls cricket-first *"the single most important strategic
recommendation in this document"*; `13a` Sprint 7 gates on a working CricClubs deep-link.
`grep` over `lib/` and `supabase/`: CricClubs 0, Playtomic 0, Strava 0, find-a-4th 0,
women-only 0, Ramadan/prayer-time 0.

**Consequence:** `docs/BRIEF.md` rewritten — §§1–7 filled from the corpus (retiring most of
the ten `NEEDS PO INPUT` markers), §§8–14 carrying seven blockers, fourteen internal
contradictions, seven gaps, and a per-document improvement list. Five decisions logged as
`P-001`–`P-005`. Five new blocker tickets raised: KAN-51 (analytics), KAN-52 (data export),
KAN-53 (Arabic switcher), KAN-54 (the cricket wedge — PO decision), KAN-55 (hold the venue
partner pack — it contracts deliverables that do not exist). `docs/ROADMAP.md` needs a
promotion-gate wave carrying the five blockers; not yet written.

**Escalated:** six questions to the PO, `BRIEF.md` §14. The two that block other work —
(1) **which financial model is the plan**: `00`/`02`/`03` say ~$1.5M Year 1 on 50K MAU,
`12c` says $82K base — 13–27× apart, and until it is settled "on track" has no meaning;
(2) **does the App Fee stand** — `12b` charges free players AED 1.3 per transaction and
takes 80% of the organiser uplift out of what a player pays, against `01` Permanent Truth 1,
`02`'s *"Dabbler does not extract value from players"* and `04` Non-Negotiable 1, which
`04` Art. 33.1 says no officer may waive. This must be ruled on before any pricing is built.

**Handoff:** `cto` owns B1 (KAN-36/37/38) and the technical shape of KAN-51/52/53.
`master-analyst` owns `PROJECT_STATE.md`, which this analysis consumed rather than
re-measured. KAN-54 and KAN-55 are the PO's, not an agent's.

## 2026-08-29 — Backlog clearance + MVP 1+ prep

**Notion corpus study: COMPLETE.** All 26 documents read and mapped (`corpus-map` memory).
No document remains unprocessed. The container/child traps (`06`, `07`, `08`, `11`,
financial model, Sport Reference) are all resolved to their children; `11 v2` supersedes v1.

**Backlog closed:**
- **KAN-29** (rewards) — framing posted. Verdict ALIGNED WITH CONSEQUENCE. Gamification is
  committed (`05` slide 4, `11 v2` §F.3, `13a` Sprint 11, `14` D52–D54) so the slice cannot
  be buried wholesale, but only the 3-tier surface is Phase 1A. Recommended: keep the ~985
  LOC check-in surface, cut the 19,560 above it, revisit at Stage 2. Three sub-questions
  isolated as genuinely the PO's.
- **KAN-30** (clean architecture) — verdict NOT ESTABLISHED, **and reassigned**. The corpus
  contains no reference to internal code architecture in any of the 26 documents. This is
  `cto`'s under `CONTRACT.md`, not the PO's. One product constraint handed over: it must not
  sit between now and closing the P0s.

**Deliverable:** `docs/briefs/MVP1-PLUS-LAUNCH-CHECKLIST-DRAFT.md` — draft only, for a
negotiation. Part A is the promotion gate judged against `13b`'s ten P0s (5 red, 1 amber,
2 unverified). Part B is next-release scope. Part C is 8 open questions.

**The finding I most want the PO to see:** P0-7 (monitoring) and P0-8 (rollback) are the only
two P0 criteria with **no ticket and no owner**. They are also what makes the rest of the gate
measurable and a bad promotion recoverable.
